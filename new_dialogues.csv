1,"00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:42,726"
2,Are you a doctor?
3,2
4,"00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:43,852"
5,Yes. Yes.
6,3
7,"00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:45,062"
8,He's an actor.
9,4
10,"00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:46,897"
11,"Oh, an actor."
12,5
13,"00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:48,732"
14,We're very popular with actors.
15,6
16,"00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:50,525"
17,"Have I, uh, seen you in anything?"
18,7
19,"00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:53,528"
20,Let's see. I did Hamlet a
21,"while back, didn't I, Liz?"
22,8
23,"00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,073"
24,"And then we did, the, uh,"
25,The Sandpiper.
26,9
27,"00:02:56,114 --> 00:02:58,033"
28,He's joking.
29,He was in Luther
30,10
31,"00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,743"
32,and Nobody Loves an Albatross
33,11
34,"00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:02,245"
35,and a lot of television
36,plays and commercials.
37,12
38,"00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:04,081"
39,"Well, that's where the money"
40,"is, isn't it? Commercials."
41,13
42,"00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:05,791"
43,"And the artistic thrills, too."
44,14
45,"00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:14,383"
46,"7, Diego."
47,15
48,"00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:16,259"
49,"Originally, the smallest"
50,apartment was a 9.
51,16
52,"00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:18,637"
53,They've been broken up into
54,"four, fives, and sixes."
55,17
56,"00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:21,223"
57,"Now, 7-E is a four,"
58,18
59,"00:03:21,264 --> 00:03:23,558"
60,originally the back part of a 10.
61,19
62,"00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,519"
63,It has the original dining
64,"room for its living room,"
65,20
66,"00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,604"
67,"another bedroom for the bedroom,"
68,21
69,"00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,272"
70,and two servants' rooms
71,thrown together
72,22
73,"00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,108"
74,for a dining room or a second bedroom.
75,23
76,"00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,110"
77,Do you have children?
78,24
79,"00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:35,153"
80,"Uh, we plan to."
81,25
82,"00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,657"
83,"We must oil that gate,"
84,Diego.
85,26
86,"00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:42,828"
87,"This way, please."
88,27
89,"00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,921"
90,"The previous tenant, Mrs. Gardenia,"
91,28
92,"00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:54,965"
93,"passed away just a few days ago,"
94,29
95,"00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:56,800"
96,So nothing has been moved yet.
97,30
98,"00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,010"
99,Her son asked me to say that
100,some of the furniture
101,31
102,"00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:01,221"
103,could be picked up practically
104,for the asking.
105,32
106,"00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:03,098"
107,Did she die in the apartment?
108,33
109,"00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,349"
110,Not that it makes any difference.
111,34
112,"00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,309"
113,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
114,In a hospital.
115,35
116,"00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:08,603"
117,She'd been in a coma for weeks.
118,36
119,"00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:09,813"
120,"After you, please."
121,37
122,"00:04:09,813 --> 00:04:11,106"
123,Thank you.
124,38
125,"00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,067"
126,She was very old
127,39
128,"00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,528"
129,and passed away without ever waking.
130,40
131,"00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,697"
132,I'd be grateful to go that way
133,myself when the time comes.
134,41
135,"00:04:20,824 --> 00:04:23,243"
136,"Oh, no, no, no, not"
137,"in the apartment, no."
138,42
139,"00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:27,372"
140,"She was chipper right to the end,"
141,43
142,"00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:29,458"
143,been one of the first women
144,lawyers in New York state.
145,44
146,"00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:31,334"
147,Did a little gardening on
148,"the side, too."
149,45
150,"00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:32,878"
151,She was quite a woman.
152,46
153,"00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,171"
154,"Oh, closet."
155,47
156,"00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:36,423"
157,"Oh, plenty of closets."
158,48
159,"00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:40,218"
160,"Oh, nice view of the park."
161,49
162,"00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,344"
163,"Oh, very nice view."
164,50
165,"00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:42,971"
166,Yeah.
167,51
168,"00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:44,139"
169,"Now, this room, for instance,"
170,52
171,"00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:46,224"
172,it would make a lovely nursery.
173,53
174,"00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:47,976"
175,Yes. Yellow and white wallpaper
176,54
177,"00:04:48,018 --> 00:04:49,895"
178,would brighten it tremendously.
179,55
180,"00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:51,521"
181,What are all these things here?
182,56
183,"00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:53,356"
184,"Herbs, mostly."
185,57
186,"00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:54,733"
187,A nice large bathroom.
188,58
189,"00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,693"
190,"Mmm. Mint, basil."
191,59
192,"00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:58,487"
193,Yeah.
194,No marijuana?
195,60
196,"00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:01,156"
197,Come on.
198,61
199,"00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:08,830"
200,"The, uh, master bedroom."
201,62
202,"00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:10,457"
203,"Oh, yes."
204,63
205,"00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:11,833"
206,"Here we are, back at the hallway again."
207,64
208,"00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,336"
209,There.
210,65
211,"00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:17,005"
212,Oh.
213,66
214,"00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:18,131"
215,"Oh, Guy!"
216,67
217,"00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:19,424"
218,Yeah.
219,68
220,"00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,592"
221,Ohh!
222,69
223,"00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:21,635"
224,"The fireplace works,"
225,of course.
226,70
227,"00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:22,719"
228,Great.
229,71
230,"00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:24,805"
231,Ohl
232,72
233,"00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,933"
234,"Oh, it's a wonderful apartment."
235,I love it!
236,73
237,"00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:29,476"
238,See what she's trying to do?
239,74
240,"00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:31,144"
241,She's trying to get you
242,"to lower the rent, see?"
243,75
244,"00:05:31,186 --> 00:05:33,438"
245,Yes.
246,"Well, we'd raise it if we were allowed."
247,76
248,"00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,190"
249,Apartments with this kind of charm--
250,77
251,"00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:40,403"
252,"Why, that's odd."
253,78
254,"00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:47,244"
255,There's a closet behind that secretary.
256,79
257,"00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:50,247"
258,I'm su--
259,I'm sure there is.
260,80
261,"00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:51,915"
262,"Yeah. Oh, I think you're right."
263,81
264,"00:05:56,253 --> 00:05:57,921"
265,She moved it.
266,It used to be there.
267,82
268,"00:06:04,594 --> 00:06:06,263"
269,"Ohh! Give me a hand, will you?"
270,83
271,"00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:31,872"
272,I see now why she went into a coma.
273,84
274,"00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:34,124"
275,"Ha, ha, hal"
276,85
277,"00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:35,542"
278,She couldn't have lifted it by herself.
279,86
280,"00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:37,043"
281,She was 89.
282,87
283,"00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:38,420"
284,Should we open it?
285,88
286,"00:06:38,461 --> 00:06:39,921"
287,Maybe her son should.
288,89
289,"00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,384"
290,I'm authorized to show the apartment.
291,90
292,"00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,262"
293,Well!
294,91
295,"00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:48,972"
296,Whatever she locked in
297,got out.
298,92
299,"00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:52,183"
300,"Well, perhaps she didn't"
301,need five closets.
302,93
303,"00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,728"
304,Why would she cover up her vacuum
305,cleaner and her towels?
306,94
307,"00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,481"
308,I don't suppose we'll ever know.
309,95
310,"00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,775"
311,Maybe she was becoming senile after all.
312,96
313,"00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:02,277"
314,Is there anything else?
315,97
316,"00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,070"
317,"Yes, please. What about"
318,the laundry facilities?
319,98
320,"00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,906"
321,It's bigger than the other one.
322,99
323,"00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:07,782"
324,"Yeah. It's more expensive,"
325,"too, you know?"
326,100
327,"00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:11,161"
328,It's better located.
329,101
330,"00:07:11,202 --> 00:07:12,787"
331,"Yeah, well, God knows,"
332,102
333,"00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:14,372"
334,I could walk to all the
335,theaters from here.
336,103
337,"00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:16,458"
338,"Oh, Guy, let's take it, please?"
339,104
340,"00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:18,001"
341,That living room could be--
342,105
343,"00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:19,669"
344,"Oh, please, let's take it."
345,106
346,"00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:22,255"
347,"Okay, darling, we get out"
348,"of the other lease, okay."
349,107
350,"00:07:22,297 --> 00:07:23,882"
351,I was tempted to write the management
352,108
353,"00:07:23,924 --> 00:07:26,009"
354,that you were drug addicts
355,and litterbugs.
356,109
357,"00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:28,345"
358,"Instead, I decided to lie"
359,110
360,"00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:29,888"
361,and tell them you were
362,wonderful tenants.
363,111
364,"00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,182"
365,"Oh, you're great, Hutch."
366,112
367,"00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:33,600"
368,"Wish I could talk you out of it, though."
369,113
370,"00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,101"
371,"He's pulling your leg, Ro honey."
372,114
373,"00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:36,686"
374,Indeed I'm not.
375,115
376,"00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:38,521"
377,"Now, that looks great."
378,That is--
379,116
380,"00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:40,106"
381,Are you aware that the Bramford
382,117
383,"00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:43,693"
384,had rather an unpleasant reputation
385,around the turn of the century?
386,118
387,"00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,862"
388,It's where the Trench sisters
389,119
390,"00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:48,531"
391,conducted their little
392,dietary experiments
393,120
394,"00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:50,867"
395,and Keith Kennedy held his parties.
396,121
397,"00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,286"
398,"Adrian Marcato lived there, too."
399,So did Pearl Ames.
400,122
401,"00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:54,371"
402,Who were the Trench sisters?
403,123
404,"00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:55,705"
405,Who was Adrian Marcato?
406,124
407,"00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:58,833"
408,The Trench sisters were two
409,proper Victorian ladies.
410,125
411,"00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,045"
412,They cooked and ate several young
413,"children, including a niece."
414,126
415,"00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:03,546"
416,"Oh, lovely."
417,127
418,"00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:06,216"
419,Adrian Marcato practiced witchcraft.
420,128
421,"00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:08,051"
422,He made quite a splash in the nineties
423,129
424,"00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:10,720"
425,by announcing that he'd conjured
426,up the living devil.
427,130
428,"00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,597"
429,"Apparently, people believed him,"
430,131
431,"00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,391"
432,so they attacked and nearly killed him
433,132
434,"00:08:14,432 --> 00:08:15,892"
435,in the lobby of the Bramford.
436,133
437,"00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:17,477"
438,You're joking.
439,134
440,"00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,562"
441,"Later, the Keith Kennedy business began,"
442,135
443,"00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:22,065"
444,"and by the twenties, the"
445,house was half empty.
446,136
447,"00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:23,566"
448,I knew about Keith Kennedy.
449,137
450,"00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,151"
451,I didn't know that Marcato
452,lived there.
453,138
454,"00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:26,486"
455,And those sisters.
456,139
457,"00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:28,071"
458,World War ll filled the house up again.
459,140
460,"00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:30,407"
461,Terrific.
462,141
463,"00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:31,866"
464,What? The house?
465,142
466,"00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:33,118"
467,The lamb.
468,Oh.
469,143
470,"00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,620"
471,They called it Black Bramford.
472,144
473,"00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:39,249"
474,"But, Hutch, awful things happen"
475,in every apartment house.
476,145
477,"00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,626"
478,"Ah, but this house has a high incidence"
479,of unpleasant happenings.
480,146
481,"00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:45,338"
482,"In '59, a dead infant was found,"
483,147
484,"00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,590"
485,wrapped in newspaper in the basement.
486,148
487,"00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:49,926"
488,Mmm! You really rouse my appetite.
489,149
490,"00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:52,429"
491,Have some more wine.
492,150
493,"00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:31,384"
494,Roman!
495,151
496,"00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:33,553"
497,Bring me in some root beer
498,when you come!
499,152
500,"00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:10,924"
501,"Hey, these are shelves."
502,153
503,"00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:26,689"
504,Hey...
505,154
506,"00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:28,525"
507,let's make love.
508,155
509,"00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,110"
510,Shh!
511,156
512,"00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,281"
513,I think I hear the Trench
514,sisters chewing.
515,157
516,"00:11:58,323 --> 00:11:59,616"
517,Ohl
518,158
519,"00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:13,630"
520,Straight up to the left.
521,159
522,"00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:16,382"
523,"Here in Daytona, Florida,"
524,160
525,"00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:18,801"
526,it's the 250-cc 100-mile classic
527,161
528,"00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:21,679"
529,with Yamaha leading the
530,pack on the final lap...
531,162
532,"00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,974"
533,"and winning it, as Yamaha takes"
534,7 of the top 10 places.
535,163
536,"00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:27,685"
537,It's the third straight year
538,"for Yamaha, a clean sweep."
539,164
540,"00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:30,772"
541,"Yamaha is race bred from champions,"
542,165
543,"00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:32,065"
544,"and, as you can see,"
545,166
546,"00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:34,567"
547,we have a model for
548,every kind of riding.
549,167
550,"00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:37,403"
551,"You know, you really should discover"
552,the swingin' world of Yamaha.
553,168
554,"00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:38,488"
555,"Why don't you get on, have a ride?"
556,169
557,"00:12:38,488 --> 00:12:39,948"
558,Come on. Get on.
559,170
560,"00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:41,324"
561,"Okay, come on."
562,Let's go.
563,171
564,"00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:48,331"
565,Look.
566,172
567,"00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:56,130"
568,It's great.
569,173
570,"00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,275"
571,I'm sorry. I thought you were
572,"Victoria Vetri, the actress."
573,174
574,"00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:17,694"
575,I'm sorry.
576,175
577,"00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:19,028"
578,That's all right.
579,176
580,"00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:20,697"
581,A lot of people think I'm Victoria.
582,177
583,"00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:22,323"
584,I don't see any resemblance.
585,178
586,"00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:23,408"
587,Do you know her?
588,179
589,"00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:24,659"
590,No.
591,180
592,"00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:29,163"
593,My name's Terry Gionoffrio.
594,181
595,"00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,541"
596,Nice to meet you.
597,I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.
598,182
599,"00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:34,043"
600,"Uh, we-- We're new tenants here."
601,183
602,"00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:36,462"
603,"I'm staying with the Castevets,"
604,seventh floor.
605,184
606,"00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:38,715"
607,"I'm their guest, sort of, since June."
608,185
609,"00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:40,717"
610,Our apartment used to be
611,the back part of yours.
612,186
613,"00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:42,093"
614,"Oh, for goodness sakes."
615,187
616,"00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:43,720"
617,You took the old lady's
618,"apartment. Mrs., uh--"
619,188
620,"00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,264"
621,"Yeah, um, Miss, uh..."
622,Gard-- Gardenia.
623,189
624,"00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:49,058"
625,Gardenia. Yeah.
626,She was a good friend of the Castevets.
627,190
628,"00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,727"
629,She used to grow all kinds of herbs
630,and things for her to cook with.
631,191
632,"00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:52,854"
633,I saw those plants.
634,192
635,"00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:53,813"
636,"Yeah. Well, now, she"
637,grows her own things.
638,193
639,"00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:56,232"
640,Excuse me a moment.
641,I have to put the softener in.
642,194
643,"00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,403"
644,What does your husband do?
645,He's an actor.
646,195
647,"00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:01,696"
648,No kidding?
649,What's his name?
650,196
651,"00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:03,072"
652,Guy Woodhouse.
653,197
654,"00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:06,743"
655,He was in Luther and Nobody
656,"Loves an Albatross,"
657,198
658,"00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,077"
659,and he does a lot of
660,television and radio.
661,199
662,"00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:11,247"
663,"Gee, I watch TV all day long."
664,200
665,"00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:12,457"
666,I'll bet I've seen him.
667,201
668,"00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,752"
669,Wow!
670,Ooh!
671,202
672,"00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:18,254"
673,I hate this basement.
674,203
675,"00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:19,547"
676,"Yeah, me, too."
677,204
678,"00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:21,090"
679,It gives me the creeps.
680,205
681,"00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:22,717"
682,"Listen, why don't we come"
683,down here together regular
684,206
685,"00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,968"
686,and do our laundry?
687,207
688,"00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,928"
689,"Okay, that would be great."
690,208
691,"00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:27,513"
692,I have a good luck charm.
693,209
694,"00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:28,723"
695,It might work for both of us.
696,210
697,"00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,560"
698,"Oh, that's beautiful."
699,211
700,"00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:34,604"
701,Isn't it?
702,Mmm-hmm!
703,212
704,"00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:36,647"
705,Mrs. Castevet gave it to me.
706,It's good luck.
707,213
708,"00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,066"
709,"Anyway, it's supposed to be."
710,214
711,"00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:39,025"
712,It's got some stuff inside.
713,215
714,"00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:44,697"
715,"Ha, ha, hal"
716,216
717,"00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:46,282"
718,I'm not mad about the smell either.
719,217
720,"00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:47,575"
721,I hope it works.
722,218
723,"00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:48,826"
724,"It's a beautiful charm, though."
725,219
726,"00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:50,620"
727,I've never seen anything like it.
728,220
729,"00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:52,622"
730,European.
731,221
732,"00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:55,833"
733,The Castevets are the most wonderful
734,"people in the world, bar none."
735,222
736,"00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,502"
737,"You know, they picked me up"
738,"off the sidewalk, literally?"
739,223
740,"00:14:57,543 --> 00:14:58,461"
741,You were sick?
742,224
743,"00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:00,963"
744,I was starving and on dope
745,225
746,"00:15:00,963 --> 00:15:02,632"
747,and doing a lot of other things.
748,226
749,"00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:03,883"
750,"They're childless, though."
751,227
752,"00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:05,802"
753,I'm like the daughter they never had.
754,228
755,"00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:08,221"
756,"At first, I thought they wanted"
757,"me for some kind of sex thing,"
758,229
759,"00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:09,889"
760,but they've turned out to
761,be like real grandparents.
762,230
763,"00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,226"
764,It's nice to know there
765,are people like that
766,231
767,"00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:15,770"
768,when you hear so much about apathy
769,232
770,"00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:18,314"
771,and people who are afraid
772,of getting involved.
773,233
774,"00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:20,066"
775,I'd be dead now if it wasn't for them.
776,234
777,"00:15:20,108 --> 00:15:22,693"
778,"That's an absolute fact,"
779,dead or in jail.
780,235
781,"00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:24,779"
782,You don't have any family
783,that could have helped you?
784,236
785,"00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,323"
786,A brother in the navy.
787,237
788,"00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:31,536"
789,"Why, it's impossible to be 100% sure!"
790,238
791,"00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:34,664"
792,"If you want my opinion, we"
793,shouldn't tell her at all!
794,239
795,"00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:35,957"
796,That's my opinion!
797,240
798,"00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:38,167"
799,That must be the partition.
800,241
801,"00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:42,171"
802,That's the back part of the original
803,"10 with a dining room,"
804,242
805,"00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:44,090"
806,and there's--
807,"there's a closet over here,"
808,243
809,"00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:45,341"
810,and then there's a closet over here.
811,244
812,"00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,174"
813,"Stay back, huh, lady?"
814,245
815,"00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,975"
816,"Get back now, will you, please?"
817,246
818,"00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:37,310"
819,Get back. There's nothing to see.
820,247
821,"00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,228"
822,"Get back, will you, please?"
823,248
824,"00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:42,982"
825,Jesus.
826,249
827,"00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,193"
828,Get back!
829,250
830,"00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:46,527"
831,We know her.
832,251
833,"00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:47,528"
834,What's her name?
835,252
836,"00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:49,447"
837,Terry.
838,253
839,"00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:50,406"
840,Terry what?
841,254
842,"00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,533"
843,Ro?
844,255
845,"00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:53,576"
846,What was her name again?
847,256
848,"00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:54,827"
849,Terry what?
850,257
851,"00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:56,162"
852,uh...
853,258
854,"00:16:56,204 --> 00:16:58,414"
855,I don't remember.
856,An Italian name.
857,259
858,"00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:00,082"
859,She was staying with some
860,"people named Castevet,"
861,260
862,"00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:01,209"
863,7-E.
864,261
865,"00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,919"
866,Yeah. We got that already.
867,262
868,"00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:05,755"
869,Short and sweet.
870,263
871,"00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:07,840"
872,She stuck it to the windowsill
873,with a Band-Aid. Come on.
874,264
875,"00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,841"
876,Get back.
877,265
878,"00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:10,468"
879,Theresa Gionoffrio.
880,266
881,"00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,802"
882,Move on!
883,267
884,"00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:13,262"
885,Move on!
886,268
887,"00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:15,973"
888,You knew her?
889,269
890,"00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:17,683"
891,Only slightly.
892,270
893,"00:17:17,725 --> 00:17:19,060"
894,"Come on, Ro baby."
895,Let's go.
896,271
897,"00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:20,478"
898,Oh! Here they come.
899,272
900,"00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:26,192"
901,You folks the Castevets
902,on the seventh floor?
903,273
904,"00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:27,443"
905,We are.
906,274
907,"00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:28,486"
908,You have a young woman
909,275
910,"00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:30,863"
911,named Theresa Gionoffrio
912,living with you?
913,276
914,"00:17:30,905 --> 00:17:32,949"
915,We do. What's wrong?
916,Has there been an accident?
917,277
918,"00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,408"
919,You'd better brace yourself
920,278
921,"00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,618"
922,for some bad news.
923,279
924,"00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:36,661"
925,She's dead.
926,280
927,"00:17:37,662 --> 00:17:39,080"
928,Jumped out of the window.
929,281
930,"00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:41,582"
931,That's not possible!
932,That's a mistake!
933,282
934,"00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:44,293"
935,"Artie, you want to let these"
936,"folks take a look, please?"
937,283
938,"00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:48,631"
939,I knew this would happen.
940,284
941,"00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:52,301"
942,She got deeply depressed
943,every three weeks or so.
944,285
945,"00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:54,428"
946,"I told my wife about it,"
947,but she pooh-poohed me.
948,286
949,"00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:58,975"
950,"Well, that-- that doesn't"
951,mean she killed herself.
952,287
953,"00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:00,726"
954,She was a very happy girl
955,288
956,"00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:02,478"
957,with no reason for self-destruction.
958,289
959,"00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,189"
960,She must have been cleaning
961,the windows or something.
962,290
963,"00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:06,941"
964,She wasn't cleaning windows at midnight.
965,291
966,"00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:08,818"
967,Why not? Maybe she was!
968,292
969,"00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:09,944"
970,Is that her handwriting?
971,293
972,"00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:13,864"
973,Yeah.
974,294
975,"00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:15,283"
976,Definitely.
977,Absolutely.
978,295
979,"00:18:15,324 --> 00:18:16,659"
980,Thank you.
981,296
982,"00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:18,911"
983,I'll see this gets back to
984,you when we're done with it.
985,297
986,"00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:20,037"
987,I don't believe it.
988,298
989,"00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,330"
990,I just don't believe it.
991,299
992,"00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:22,832"
993,She was so happy.
994,300
995,"00:18:22,873 --> 00:18:24,292"
996,Who's the next of kin?
997,301
998,"00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,210"
999,She's all alone.
1000,"She didn't have anybody,"
1001,302
1002,"00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:27,587"
1003,only us.
1004,303
1005,"00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:30,172"
1006,Didn't she have a brother?
1007,Did she?
1008,304
1009,"00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:32,717"
1010,She said she did.
1011,In the navy.
1012,305
1013,"00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:34,176"
1014,News to me.
1015,306
1016,"00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:35,636"
1017,Do you know where he's stationed?
1018,307
1019,"00:18:35,678 --> 00:18:37,972"
1020,"No, I don't."
1021,308
1022,"00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:40,600"
1023,She mentioned him to me
1024,in the laundry room.
1025,309
1026,"00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,851"
1027,I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.
1028,310
1029,"00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,270"
1030,"Uh, we're in, uh, 7-E."
1031,311
1032,"00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:46,439"
1033,I feel just the way you
1034,"do, Mrs. Castevet."
1035,312
1036,"00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,525"
1037,She seemed so happy and full of--
1038,313
1039,"00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:52,194"
1040,She said wonderful things
1041,"about you and your husband,"
1042,314
1043,"00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:53,696"
1044,how grateful she was.
1045,315
1046,"00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:55,239"
1047,Thank you.
1048,316
1049,"00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:56,574"
1050,You know anything else
1051,about this brother
1052,317
1053,"00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:57,783"
1054,except he's in the navy?
1055,318
1056,"00:18:57,825 --> 00:18:59,035"
1057,"No, I don't."
1058,319
1059,"00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:00,244"
1060,It should be easy
1061,to find him.
1062,320
1063,"00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:02,288"
1064,Okay.
1065,321
1066,"00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,040"
1067,I'm so stunned.
1068,I'm so sorry.
1069,322
1070,"00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,416"
1071,It's such a pity.
1072,323
1073,"00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,375"
1074,"Well, thank you."
1075,324
1076,"00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,461"
1077,Sometimes I wonder how come you're
1078,the leader of anything.
1079,325
1080,"00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,763"
1081,Please don't tell me
1082,what Laura-Louise said
1083,326
1084,"00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:02,807"
1085,because I'm not interested.
1086,327
1087,"00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:03,974"
1088,"If you'd listened to me,"
1089,328
1090,"00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:06,268"
1091,we wouldn't have had to do this!
1092,329
1093,"00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,104"
1094,We'd have been all set to go now
1095,330
1096,"00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:10,523"
1097,instead of having to start
1098,all over from scratch!
1099,331
1100,"00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:12,483"
1101,I told you not to tell her in advance!
1102,332
1103,"00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:14,735"
1104,I told you she wouldn't be open-minded!
1105,333
1106,"00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,366"
1107,I told Sister Veronica
1108,"about the windows,"
1109,334
1110,"00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:22,284"
1111,and she withdrew the school
1112,from the competition.
1113,335
1114,"00:20:22,284 --> 00:20:23,619"
1115,"Otherwise, we would--"
1116,336
1117,"00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,379"
1118,Hello. How are you?
1119,337
1120,"00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:34,839"
1121,Fine. May I come in a minute?
1122,338
1123,"00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,257"
1124,"Yes, of course. Please do."
1125,339
1126,"00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:37,675"
1127,I just come over to thank you
1128,340
1129,"00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:39,385"
1130,for saying those nice things
1131,to us the other night.
1132,341
1133,"00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:40,970"
1134,"Oh, no, please."
1135,There's--
1136,342
1137,"00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,846"
1138,Poor Terry.
1139,343
1140,"00:20:41,846 --> 00:20:43,556"
1141,We thought maybe we'd
1142,"failed her some way,"
1143,344
1144,"00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:45,599"
1145,although her note made it
1146,crystal clear we hadn't.
1147,345
1148,"00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:47,560"
1149,You'll never know how helpful it was
1150,346
1151,"00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:49,103"
1152,in such a shock moment.
1153,347
1154,"00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:50,479"
1155,So I do thank you.
1156,"Roman does, too."
1157,348
1158,"00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:52,773"
1159,Roman's my hubby.
1160,349
1161,"00:20:52,815 --> 00:20:53,983"
1162,You're welcome.
1163,350
1164,"00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,276"
1165,I'm glad I could help.
1166,351
1167,"00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:58,195"
1168,"Yeah. Well, she was cremated yesterday."
1169,352
1170,"00:20:58,237 --> 00:20:59,947"
1171,Now we got to forget and go on.
1172,353
1173,"00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:02,158"
1174,It won't be easy.
1175,We don't have any children of our own.
1176,354
1177,"00:21:02,158 --> 00:21:03,409"
1178,You have any?
1179,"No, we don't."
1180,355
1181,"00:21:03,451 --> 00:21:04,785"
1182,"Oh, well, there you have it."
1183,356
1184,"00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:06,912"
1185,"Ohh! Oh,"
1186,357
1187,"00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:08,748"
1188,that's a nice--
1189,358
1190,"00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,207"
1191,Look how you put the table!
1192,359
1193,"00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:11,709"
1194,"Now, isn't that interesting?"
1195,360
1196,"00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:13,002"
1197,I saw it in a magazine.
1198,361
1199,"00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:15,629"
1200,"Oh, my. Nice paint job."
1201,362
1202,"00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:16,839"
1203,I know.
1204,363
1205,"00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:18,424"
1206,Ahh... well.
1207,364
1208,"00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:19,675"
1209,That's nice.
1210,What is that?
1211,365
1212,"00:21:19,717 --> 00:21:21,010"
1213,That's the TV room?
1214,366
1215,"00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:22,803"
1216,"Yeah, well, only temporarily."
1217,367
1218,"00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:24,096"
1219,It's going to be a nursery.
1220,368
1221,"00:21:24,138 --> 00:21:25,181"
1222,"Oh, you're pregnant?"
1223,369
1224,"00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,599"
1225,"No, not yet."
1226,370
1227,"00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,350"
1228,I hope to be as soon as we're settled.
1229,371
1230,"00:21:28,392 --> 00:21:30,269"
1231,"Wonderful. Well, you're"
1232,young and healthy.
1233,372
1234,"00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:31,771"
1235,You ought to have lots of children.
1236,373
1237,"00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:33,522"
1238,We plan to have three.
1239,374
1240,"00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:35,399"
1241,I'm dying to see what you
1242,did to this apartment.
1243,375
1244,"00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,318"
1245,The woman who had it before
1246,was a dear friend of mine.
1247,376
1248,"00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,652"
1249,I know.
1250,Terry told me.
1251,377
1252,"00:21:38,694 --> 00:21:40,029"
1253,"Oh, did she?"
1254,378
1255,"00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,031"
1256,You two had some long talks
1257,together in the laundry room.
1258,379
1259,"00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:43,240"
1260,Only one.
1261,380
1262,"00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:45,534"
1263,"Oh! Oh, my goodness!"
1264,381
1265,"00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:48,370"
1266,"Ah, ha, ha! It looks so much brighter."
1267,382
1268,"00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:50,498"
1269,What do you pay for a chair like that?
1270,383
1271,"00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:51,832"
1272,"Uh, oh..."
1273,384
1274,"00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:53,167"
1275,"um, I'm not sure, really."
1276,385
1277,"00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,543"
1278,I think about $200.
1279,386
1280,"00:21:54,585 --> 00:21:55,711"
1281,Hmm.
1282,387
1283,"00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:58,589"
1284,What does your hubby do?
1285,388
1286,"00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:00,216"
1287,He's an actor.
1288,389
1289,"00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:02,885"
1290,I knew it! I said it to Roman yesterday.
1291,390
1292,"00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:05,054"
1293,He's so good-looking.
1294,391
1295,"00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:06,680"
1296,What movies was he in?
1297,392
1298,"00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:08,140"
1299,No movies.
1300,393
1301,"00:22:08,182 --> 00:22:09,892"
1302,He was in two plays called Luther
1303,394
1304,"00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:11,519"
1305,and Nobody Loves an Albatross
1306,395
1307,"00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,771"
1308,and a lot of television and radio.
1309,396
1310,"00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:15,189"
1311,"Listen, Rosemary..."
1312,397
1313,"00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:17,066"
1314,I got a 2-inch thick sirloin steak
1315,398
1316,"00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:18,651"
1317,sitting defrosting right this minute.
1318,399
1319,"00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:20,069"
1320,"Why don't you and Guy come over,"
1321,400
1322,"00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:21,111"
1323,have supper with us tonight?
1324,401
1325,"00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:22,363"
1326,What do you say?
1327,402
1328,"00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:23,531"
1329,"Oh, no. We couldn't."
1330,403
1331,"00:22:23,572 --> 00:22:24,824"
1332,Why not?
1333,404
1334,"00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:27,076"
1335,"No, really, that's very kind of you."
1336,Listen--
1337,405
1338,"00:22:27,117 --> 00:22:29,328"
1339,It would be a real help to us. Oh--
1340,406
1341,"00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,456"
1342,First night we'll be alone since--
1343,407
1344,"00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:34,959"
1345,"Oh, are you sure it wouldn't"
1346,be too much trouble for you?
1347,408
1348,"00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,335"
1349,"Oh, honey, if it was trouble,"
1350,409
1351,"00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:37,795"
1352,I wouldn't ask you.
1353,410
1354,"00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:39,922"
1355,All right.
1356,You go ahead and count on us.
1357,411
1358,"00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:41,507"
1359,"I'll have to check with Guy,"
1360,though.
1361,412
1362,"00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:44,760"
1363,"Listen, you tell him I won't"
1364,take no for an answer!
1365,413
1366,"00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:46,220"
1367,Oh! Here's your mail!
1368,414
1369,"00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:47,596"
1370,Oh! Ads!
1371,415
1372,"00:22:47,638 --> 00:22:48,806"
1373,Thank you.
1374,416
1375,"00:22:58,607 --> 00:22:59,775"
1376,Yoo-hoo!
1377,417
1378,"00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:01,360"
1379,Hey.
1380,418
1381,"00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,612"
1382,Mmm!
1383,419
1384,"00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,877"
1385,Donald Baumgart got that part.
1386,420
1387,"00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:32,474"
1388,It's a bad play anyway.
1389,421
1390,"00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:34,184"
1391,"Yeah. Even if it folds out of town,"
1392,422
1393,"00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:35,477"
1394,it's the kind of part that gets noticed.
1395,423
1396,"00:23:42,902 --> 00:23:44,403"
1397,Mrs. Castevet was here
1398,424
1399,"00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:47,406"
1400,to thank me for what I said about Terry.
1401,425
1402,"00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:51,660"
1403,She is the nosiest person
1404,I've ever seen.
1405,426
1406,"00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:54,163"
1407,You know she actually asked
1408,the prices of things?
1409,427
1410,"00:23:54,204 --> 00:23:55,497"
1411,No kidding.
1412,428
1413,"00:23:57,374 --> 00:23:59,919"
1414,She invited us to have dinner
1415,with them tonight.
1416,429
1417,"00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,629"
1418,"I told her I'd have to check with you,"
1419,430
1420,"00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,422"
1421,but that it would probably be okay.
1422,431
1423,"00:24:03,464 --> 00:24:05,341"
1424,"Oh, Jesus! We don't have"
1425,"to do that, do we, honey?"
1426,432
1427,"00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:08,344"
1428,I think they're lonely.
1429,433
1430,"00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:10,304"
1431,We get friendly with an
1432,"old couple like that,"
1433,434
1434,"00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:11,430"
1435,and we'll never get rid of them.
1436,435
1437,"00:24:11,472 --> 00:24:12,640"
1438,They're right across the wall.
1439,436
1440,"00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:15,017"
1441,I told her she could count on us.
1442,437
1443,"00:24:19,188 --> 00:24:20,189"
1444,You don't have to sulk about it.
1445,438
1446,"00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,440"
1447,I'm not sulking.
1448,439
1449,"00:24:21,482 --> 00:24:22,524"
1450,I see exactly what you mean.
1451,440
1452,"00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:24,860"
1453,"Hell, we'll go."
1454,441
1455,"00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:26,362"
1456,"No, no. What for?"
1457,442
1458,"00:24:26,362 --> 00:24:27,738"
1459,We'll go!
1460,443
1461,"00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,908"
1462,No. We don't have to
1463,if you don't want to.
1464,444
1465,"00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,535"
1466,"That sounds so phony, but I"
1467,"really mean it, really, I do."
1468,445
1469,"00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:36,664"
1470,Be my good deed for the day.
1471,446
1472,"00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,502"
1473,"Okay, but only if you want to."
1474,447
1475,"00:24:41,543 --> 00:24:43,712"
1476,We'll make it clear that it's
1477,just for this one night
1478,448
1479,"00:24:43,754 --> 00:24:46,507"
1480,and not the beginning
1481,"of anything, right?"
1482,449
1483,"00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:49,218"
1484,Oh! Perfect timing!
1485,Come oniin.
1486,450
1487,"00:24:49,218 --> 00:24:51,637"
1488,Roman's fixing us some vodka blushes.
1489,451
1490,"00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,889"
1491,"My, I'm glad you could come, Guy."
1492,452
1493,"00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:56,600"
1494,I'm fixing to tell everybody
1495,that I knew you when.
1496,453
1497,"00:24:56,642 --> 00:24:58,102"
1498,"Look, dinner isn't ready just yet,"
1499,454
1500,"00:24:58,143 --> 00:24:59,561"
1501,but sit down there anywhere.
1502,455
1503,"00:24:59,561 --> 00:25:01,230"
1504,Take a seat on the couch.
1505,456
1506,"00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:02,439"
1507,You'll find yourself very comfortable.
1508,457
1509,"00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:05,025"
1510,I seem to have overfilled the glasses.
1511,458
1512,"00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:06,902"
1513,"No, no, no."
1514,Don't get up.
1515,459
1516,"00:25:06,944 --> 00:25:10,030"
1517,"Generally, I pour these out precisely"
1518,"as a bartender, don't I, Minnie?"
1519,460
1520,"00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:11,573"
1521,Just watch the carpet.
1522,461
1523,"00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:13,534"
1524,But this evening I made
1525,"a little too much,"
1526,462
1527,"00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:15,244"
1528,and rather I'm afr--
1529,"Oh, there we are."
1530,463
1531,"00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:17,204"
1532,"No, no, no."
1533,"Sit down, please."
1534,464
1535,"00:25:17,246 --> 00:25:18,872"
1536,"Now, Mrs. Woodhouse--"
1537,Thank you.
1538,465
1539,"00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:20,416"
1540,"Uh, Mr. Woodhouse,"
1541,466
1542,"00:25:20,457 --> 00:25:22,626"
1543,"uh, vodka blush?"
1544,"Yes, thanks."
1545,467
1546,"00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:24,169"
1547,Have you ever tasted one?
1548,468
1549,"00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:25,421"
1550,"No, no."
1551,I haven't.
1552,469
1553,"00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:26,714"
1554,It looks delicious.
1555,470
1556,"00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:29,425"
1557,Minnie. They're very
1558,popular in Australia.
1559,471
1560,"00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:31,802"
1561,"Now, to our guests--"
1562,Welcome to our home.
1563,472
1564,"00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:32,928"
1565,"Hear, hear."
1566,473
1567,"00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,013"
1568,Cheers.
1569,474
1570,"00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:34,972"
1571,Mmm.
1572,475
1573,"00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:39,852"
1574,The carpet.
1575,476
1576,"00:25:39,893 --> 00:25:41,228"
1577,"Oh, dear."
1578,477
1579,"00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,688"
1580,Brand-new carpet.
1581,478
1582,"00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,399"
1583,This man is so clumsy!
1584,479
1585,"00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:48,444"
1586,Do you come from Australia?
1587,480
1588,"00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:51,196"
1589,"Oh, no, no. I'm from right"
1590,here in New York City.
1591,481
1592,"00:25:51,238 --> 00:25:52,781"
1593,"I've been there, though."
1594,482
1595,"00:25:52,823 --> 00:25:55,242"
1596,"I've been everywhere, literally."
1597,483
1598,"00:25:55,284 --> 00:25:57,411"
1599,"You name a place, and I've been there."
1600,484
1601,"00:25:57,453 --> 00:25:59,246"
1602,Go ahead. Name a place.
1603,485
1604,"00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:00,456"
1605,"Fairbanks, Alaska!"
1606,486
1607,"00:26:00,456 --> 00:26:03,125"
1608,"I've been there, been all over Alaska--"
1609,487
1610,"00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:07,504"
1611,"Yes-- Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage,"
1612,"Nome, Sitka, Seward."
1613,488
1614,"00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:09,298"
1615,I spent four months there in '38--
1616,489
1617,"00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:10,424"
1618,Where are you folks from?
1619,490
1620,"00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:11,550"
1621,Well--
1622,"Well, I--"
1623,491
1624,"00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:14,636"
1625,I'm from Omaha.
1626,Guy's from Baltimore.
1627,492
1628,"00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:15,971"
1629,Omaha's a good city.
1630,493
1631,"00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:16,638"
1632,"Baltimore is, too."
1633,494
1634,"00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:19,141"
1635,Do you travel for business?
1636,495
1637,"00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:21,101"
1638,"Well, business and pleasure both."
1639,496
1640,"00:26:21,143 --> 00:26:24,688"
1641,"I'm 79, and I've been going one"
1642,place or another since I was 10.
1643,497
1644,"00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,315"
1645,"You name a place, I've been there."
1646,498
1647,"00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:27,649"
1648,Ah! Steak's ready.
1649,499
1650,"00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:28,776"
1651,"Don't rush your drinks, now."
1652,500
1653,"00:26:29,777 --> 00:26:30,986"
1654,"Roman, take your pill!"
1655,501
1656,"00:26:32,362 --> 00:26:34,156"
1657,No pope ever visits a city
1658,502
1659,"00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:35,949"
1660,where the newspapers are on strike.
1661,503
1662,"00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:37,659"
1663,I heard he's going to postpone
1664,504
1665,"00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:39,078"
1666,and wait till it's over.
1667,505
1668,"00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,995"
1669,"Well, that's show biz."
1670,506
1671,"00:26:42,498 --> 00:26:43,916"
1672,That's exactly what it is.
1673,507
1674,"00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,293"
1675,"All the costumes are rituals,"
1676,508
1677,"00:26:46,335 --> 00:26:47,878"
1678,all religions.
1679,509
1680,"00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,797"
1681,"Oh, I think we're offending Rosemary."
1682,510
1683,"00:26:49,838 --> 00:26:51,048"
1684,"No, no."
1685,511
1686,"00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,966"
1687,"No, you're not religious,"
1688,"my dear, are you?"
1689,512
1690,"00:26:53,008 --> 00:26:55,010"
1691,"Well, I was brought up a Catholic."
1692,513
1693,"00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,512"
1694,Now I don't know.
1695,514
1696,"00:26:56,512 --> 00:26:58,138"
1697,You looked uncomfortable.
1698,515
1699,"00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,765"
1700,"Well, he is the pope."
1701,516
1702,"00:26:59,807 --> 00:27:01,975"
1703,"Now, you don't need to"
1704,have respect for him
1705,517
1706,"00:27:02,017 --> 00:27:03,936"
1707,because he pretends that he's holy.
1708,518
1709,"00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:05,270"
1710,"Now, that's a good point."
1711,519
1712,"00:27:05,312 --> 00:27:08,899"
1713,When I think what they spend
1714,on robes and jewels!
1715,520
1716,"00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:12,694"
1717,A good picture of the hypocrisy
1718,behind organized religion
1719,521
1720,"00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:14,863"
1721,"was given, I thought, in Luther."
1722,522
1723,"00:27:14,905 --> 00:27:16,865"
1724,Did you ever get to play
1725,"that leading part, Guy?"
1726,523
1727,"00:27:16,907 --> 00:27:17,866"
1728,Me? No.
1729,524
1730,"00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:20,786"
1731,Weren't you Albert Finney's understudy?
1732,525
1733,"00:27:20,828 --> 00:27:22,246"
1734,No.
1735,526
1736,"00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:23,539"
1737,"Well, that's strange."
1738,527
1739,"00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,332"
1740,I remember being struck
1741,by a gesture you made
1742,528
1743,"00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:26,375"
1744,and checking in the program
1745,529
1746,"00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:27,501"
1747,to see who you were.
1748,530
1749,"00:27:27,543 --> 00:27:28,752"
1750,Thank you.
1751,531
1752,"00:27:28,794 --> 00:27:30,712"
1753,"Um, what gesture was that?"
1754,532
1755,"00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:33,882"
1756,"Well, I'm not sure now."
1757,It was a reaction--
1758,533
1759,"00:27:33,924 --> 00:27:35,884"
1760,"Oh, I did a thing with my arms"
1761,534
1762,"00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:37,511"
1763,when Luther was having a fit.
1764,535
1765,"00:27:37,553 --> 00:27:39,972"
1766,It was a kind of involuntary reach.
1767,536
1768,"00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:43,517"
1769,That's it! That's it.
1770,It had a wonderful authenticity to it.
1771,537
1772,"00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,643"
1773,"Oh, come on."
1774,538
1775,"00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:46,603"
1776,"No, no."
1777,I mean it.
1778,539
1779,"00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:48,897"
1780,"My father was a theatrical producer,"
1781,540
1782,"00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:52,025"
1783,and my early years were
1784,spent in the company
1785,541
1786,"00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:54,695"
1787,"of Mrs. Fiske, Forbes-Robertson,"
1788,Modjeska.
1789,542
1790,"00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:55,779"
1791,Guy?
1792,543
1793,"00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:57,573"
1794,"Oh, yes, please."
1795,544
1796,"00:27:57,573 --> 00:28:00,826"
1797,You have a most interesting
1798,"inner quality, Guy."
1799,545
1800,"00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:03,495"
1801,"It appears in your television work, too."
1802,546
1803,"00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:05,247"
1804,"It should take you a long way, indeed,"
1805,547
1806,"00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:08,125"
1807,"provided, of course, that you"
1808,get those initial breaks.
1809,548
1810,"00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:10,752"
1811,Are you preparing for a show now?
1812,549
1813,"00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:14,756"
1814,"Um, well, I'm up for a couple parts."
1815,550
1816,"00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:16,967"
1817,"Well, I can't believe that"
1818,you won't get them.
1819,551
1820,"00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:18,635"
1821,"Well, I can."
1822,552
1823,"00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:20,762"
1824,I'd like to have a spice garden someday.
1825,553
1826,"00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:23,891"
1827,I guess I'm a country girl at heart.
1828,554
1829,"00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:25,350"
1830,You come from a big family?
1831,555
1832,"00:28:25,392 --> 00:28:26,602"
1833,Mm-hmm.
1834,556
1835,"00:28:26,602 --> 00:28:28,061"
1836,Three brothers and two sisters.
1837,557
1838,"00:28:28,103 --> 00:28:29,104"
1839,Your sisters married?
1840,558
1841,"00:28:29,104 --> 00:28:30,355"
1842,Mm-hmm.
1843,559
1844,"00:28:30,397 --> 00:28:31,773"
1845,They have children?
1846,560
1847,"00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:34,067"
1848,"One has two, the other has four."
1849,561
1850,"00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:36,486"
1851,There's a chance you'll have
1852,"lots of children, too."
1853,562
1854,"00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:38,572"
1855,"We're fertile, all right."
1856,563
1857,"00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:40,699"
1858,I've got 16 nieces and nephews.
1859,564
1860,"00:28:40,741 --> 00:28:42,618"
1861,"Oh, my goodness!"
1862,565
1863,"00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:50,459"
1864,"Would you like me to wash, and"
1865,you can wipe for a while?
1866,566
1867,"00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:52,044"
1868,"Oh, no."
1869,"That's fine, dear."
1870,567
1871,"00:29:00,344 --> 00:29:03,639"
1872,"Now, Roman, will you stop"
1873,bending Guy's ears
1874,568
1875,"00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:05,474"
1876,with your Modjeska stories?
1877,569
1878,"00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:07,309"
1879,He's only listening 'cause he's polite.
1880,570
1881,"00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:08,852"
1882,"No, no, no, no."
1883,"It's very interesting, Mrs. Castevet."
1884,571
1885,"00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:10,229"
1886,Minnie!
1887,572
1888,"00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,897"
1889,I'm Minnie.
1890,"He's Roman, okay?"
1891,573
1892,"00:29:11,939 --> 00:29:13,398"
1893,Okay?
1894,574
1895,"00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,524"
1896,Okay.
1897,575
1898,"00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:15,817"
1899,Okay!
1900,576
1901,"00:29:15,817 --> 00:29:17,236"
1902,Terrific.
1903,Just terrific.
1904,577
1905,"00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:18,320"
1906,"Good-bye, darling."
1907,Good-bye.
1908,578
1909,"00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,571"
1910,Thank you for having us.
1911,579
1912,"00:29:19,613 --> 00:29:20,989"
1913,"Yeah, it was lovely."
1914,"Oh, bless you."
1915,580
1916,"00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:22,282"
1917,Minnie!
1918,581
1919,"00:29:22,324 --> 00:29:24,201"
1920,"Minnie, ya good kid, ya."
1921,582
1922,"00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:26,578"
1923,Ooh!
1924,"About that steak, huh?"
1925,583
1926,"00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,497"
1927,"Oh, my God!"
1928,And the cake.
1929,584
1930,"00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:29,957"
1931,How did you eat two pieces?
1932,585
1933,"00:29:29,998 --> 00:29:31,291"
1934,It was weird.
1935,586
1936,"00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,001"
1937,Out of politeness.
1938,That's how I ate two pieces.
1939,587
1940,"00:29:33,043 --> 00:29:34,086"
1941,Out of politeness.
1942,588
1943,"00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:35,963"
1944,"Ha, ha, hal"
1945,589
1946,"00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:37,881"
1947,Only three dinner plates that matched.
1948,590
1949,"00:29:37,923 --> 00:29:39,883"
1950,Shh!
1951,591
1952,"00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:42,970"
1953,"And all that beautiful,"
1954,beautiful silver.
1955,592
1956,"00:29:43,011 --> 00:29:44,012"
1957,We'll be nice.
1958,Maybe they'll will it to us.
1959,593
1960,"00:29:44,054 --> 00:29:45,180"
1961,Ohl
1962,594
1963,"00:29:45,222 --> 00:29:46,932"
1964,Yeah.
1965,595
1966,"00:29:46,974 --> 00:29:48,475"
1967,Guess what they have in their bathroom.
1968,596
1969,"00:29:48,517 --> 00:29:50,143"
1970,A bidet.
1971,597
1972,"00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:51,061"
1973,Jokes for the John.
1974,598
1975,"00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:52,604"
1976,No.
1977,599
1978,"00:29:52,646 --> 00:29:54,189"
1979,A book on a hook right
1980,next to the toilet.
1981,600
1982,"00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:57,859"
1983,Roman's stories are pretty
1984,"damned interesting, though."
1985,601
1986,"00:29:57,901 --> 00:29:58,986"
1987,Yeah?
1988,602
1989,"00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:02,656"
1990,Never even heard of Forbes-Robertson
1991,before.
1992,603
1993,"00:30:02,698 --> 00:30:05,284"
1994,I'm going to go over there again
1995,tomorrow night and hear some more.
1996,604
1997,"00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:07,244"
1998,You are?
1999,Yeah. He asked me.
2000,605
2001,"00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:09,371"
2002,Here. Do this damn thing
2003,"for me, will you?"
2004,606
2005,"00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:11,290"
2006,I thought we were going to do something
2007,with Joan and Dick Jellico.
2008,607
2009,"00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:13,542"
2010,Was that definite?
2011,"Well, it wasn't definite."
2012,608
2013,"00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:14,793"
2014,We'll see them next week.
2015,609
2016,"00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:19,214"
2017,You don't have to come along
2018,if you don't want to.
2019,610
2020,"00:30:19,256 --> 00:30:20,674"
2021,You can stay here.
2022,611
2023,"00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:23,927"
2024,"Yeah, I think I will stay here."
2025,612
2026,"00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,805"
2027,"He knew Henry Irving, too."
2028,613
2029,"00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:29,099"
2030,"I mean, really interesting, you know?"
2031,614
2032,"00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:31,059"
2033,Why did they take their pictures down?
2034,615
2035,"00:30:32,227 --> 00:30:33,603"
2036,What do you mean?
2037,616
2038,"00:30:33,645 --> 00:30:35,564"
2039,Their pictures.
2040,They took them down.
2041,617
2042,"00:30:35,605 --> 00:30:38,317"
2043,The hooks in the wall and clean spaces
2044,618
2045,"00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:40,277"
2046,and the one picture that
2047,is there doesn't fit.
2048,619
2049,"00:30:41,194 --> 00:30:42,154"
2050,I didn't notice that.
2051,620
2052,"00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:22,819"
2053,"Hi, dear. We're not bothering"
2054,"you, are we?"
2055,621
2056,"00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:24,446"
2057,This is my dear friend
2058,"Laura-Louise McBurney,"
2059,622
2060,"00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:25,781"
2061,lives up on 12.
2062,623
2063,"00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:28,075"
2064,"Laura-Louise, this is"
2065,"Guy's wife, Rosemary."
2066,624
2067,"00:31:28,116 --> 00:31:30,327"
2068,"Hello, Rosemary."
2069,Welcome to the Bram!
2070,625
2071,"00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:32,746"
2072,Laura-Louise just met Guy.
2073,"She wanted to meet you, too."
2074,626
2075,"00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:33,997"
2076,Could we come in?
2077,627
2078,"00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:36,083"
2079,"Uh, of course."
2080,Please do.
2081,628
2082,"00:31:36,124 --> 00:31:37,542"
2083,There you are.
2084,Go ahead.
2085,629
2086,"00:31:37,584 --> 00:31:38,627"
2087,"Oh, look what you got."
2088,630
2089,"00:31:38,627 --> 00:31:39,836"
2090,There's a light.
2091,631
2092,"00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:42,798"
2093,"Oh, gosh!"
2094,632
2095,"00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,716"
2096,Isn't that beautiful!
2097,633
2098,"00:31:44,758 --> 00:31:46,593"
2099,It came this morning.
2100,634
2101,"00:31:46,635 --> 00:31:48,303"
2102,"Are you all right, dear?"
2103,You look worn.
2104,635
2105,"00:31:48,345 --> 00:31:49,596"
2106,"Oh, no. I'm fine."
2107,636
2108,"00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:51,139"
2109,It's the first day of my period.
2110,637
2111,"00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:52,724"
2112,And you're up and around?
2113,638
2114,"00:31:52,766 --> 00:31:55,227"
2115,"On my first day, I experienced"
2116,"such pain,"
2117,639
2118,"00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:57,979"
2119,"I couldn't move, eat, or anything."
2120,640
2121,"00:31:58,021 --> 00:32:01,149"
2122,Dan used to give me gin through
2123,a straw to kill the pain.
2124,641
2125,"00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:03,944"
2126,Girls today take things much
2127,more in their stride.
2128,642
2129,"00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:05,529"
2130,"They're much healthier than we were,"
2131,643
2132,"00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,281"
2133,"Thanks to vitamins, better medical care."
2134,644
2135,"00:32:08,323 --> 00:32:10,492"
2136,What are those things over
2137,"there, seat covers?"
2138,645
2139,"00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:12,411"
2140,"Um, cushions for the window seats."
2141,646
2142,"00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:13,787"
2143,"Oh, yeah."
2144,647
2145,"00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,877"
2146,"Oh, before I forget."
2147,648
2148,"00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:24,339"
2149,This is for you from Roman and me.
2150,649
2151,"00:32:24,381 --> 00:32:26,341"
2152,For me?
2153,650
2154,"00:32:26,341 --> 00:32:28,635"
2155,It's just a little present
2156,is all. For moving in.
2157,651
2158,"00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:29,970"
2159,There's no reason--
2160,652
2161,"00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:31,847"
2162,It's real old.
2163,It's over 300 years.
2164,653
2165,"00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:41,940"
2166,It's lovely.
2167,654
2168,"00:32:41,982 --> 00:32:44,443"
2169,Yeah. The green inside
2170,is called tannis root.
2171,655
2172,"00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:45,819"
2173,That's for good luck.
2174,656
2175,"00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:49,364"
2176,"It's lovely, but I--"
2177,I can't accept it.
2178,657
2179,"00:32:49,364 --> 00:32:50,449"
2180,You already have.
2181,658
2182,"00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,533"
2183,Put it on.
2184,659
2185,"00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:52,826"
2186,Yeah.
2187,660
2188,"00:32:55,412 --> 00:32:58,290"
2189,"Ah, you'll get used to the"
2190,smell before you know it.
2191,661
2192,"00:32:58,331 --> 00:32:59,541"
2193,"Yeah, go on."
2194,662
2195,"00:33:01,877 --> 00:33:04,087"
2196,"Ohh, yes."
2197,663
2198,"00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:08,258"
2199,Were his stories as interesting
2200,as last night?
2201,664
2202,"00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,385"
2203,Yes. Did you have a good time?
2204,665
2205,"00:33:10,385 --> 00:33:11,636"
2206,All right.
2207,666
2208,"00:33:11,678 --> 00:33:12,888"
2209,I got a present.
2210,667
2211,"00:33:15,682 --> 00:33:16,808"
2212,It was Terry's.
2213,668
2214,"00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,059"
2215,No kidding?
2216,669
2217,"00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:19,227"
2218,"Kind of pretty, though."
2219,670
2220,"00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:24,900"
2221,Aren't you going to wear it?
2222,671
2223,"00:33:24,941 --> 00:33:26,318"
2224,Mm-mmm.
2225,It smells.
2226,672
2227,"00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:28,945"
2228,There's stuff in it called tannis root
2229,673
2230,"00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:30,822"
2231,from her greenhouse.
2232,674
2233,"00:33:30,864 --> 00:33:32,407"
2234,"Not too bad, though."
2235,675
2236,"00:33:32,449 --> 00:33:33,617"
2237,"Ha, ha, ha."
2238,676
2239,"00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:43,502"
2240,"Tannis, anyone?"
2241,677
2242,"00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:45,003"
2243,"Well, if you took it,"
2244,678
2245,"00:33:45,045 --> 00:33:46,213"
2246,you ought to wear it.
2247,679
2248,"00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:05,815"
2249,Hello.
2250,680
2251,"00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:07,234"
2252,Yes.
2253,681
2254,"00:34:07,275 --> 00:34:08,151"
2255,This is he.
2256,682
2257,"00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,952"
2258,"Oh, God, no."
2259,683
2260,"00:34:19,704 --> 00:34:20,539"
2261,"Oh, the poor guy."
2262,684
2263,"00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,251"
2264,"And, uh..."
2265,685
2266,"00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:26,711"
2267,they don't have any idea
2268,what's causing it?
2269,686
2270,"00:34:26,753 --> 00:34:28,296"
2271,"Oh, my God."
2272,That's awful.
2273,687
2274,"00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:29,381"
2275,That's just awful.
2276,688
2277,"00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:32,926"
2278,"Yes, I would."
2279,689
2280,"00:34:33,843 --> 00:34:35,136"
2281,"I mean, yes, I am."
2282,690
2283,"00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:39,182"
2284,"I hate to get it that way, but--"
2285,691
2286,"00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:43,728"
2287,"Well, you'd have to speak to my agent"
2288,692
2289,"00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,646"
2290,about that end of it.
2291,693
2292,"00:34:47,274 --> 00:34:49,025"
2293,Alan Stone.
2294,694
2295,"00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:50,652"
2296,I'm sure there won't be
2297,"any problem, Mr. Weiss,"
2298,695
2299,"00:34:50,652 --> 00:34:51,987"
2300,not as far as we're concerned.
2301,696
2302,"00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:55,323"
2303,"Thank you, Mr. Weiss."
2304,697
2305,"00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:01,329"
2306,Guy?
2307,698
2308,"00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:03,999"
2309,What is it?
2310,699
2311,"00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,672"
2312,Donald Baumgart--
2313,He's gone blind.
2314,700
2315,"00:35:12,257 --> 00:35:14,009"
2316,"He woke up yesterday, and he can't see."
2317,701
2318,"00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:16,553"
2319,"Oh, no."
2320,702
2321,"00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:17,554"
2322,"Oh, I've got the part."
2323,703
2324,"00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:20,640"
2325,It's a hell of a way to get it.
2326,704
2327,"00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,690"
2328,"Listen, uh,"
2329,705
2330,"00:35:28,732 --> 00:35:30,025"
2331,I have to get out and walk around.
2332,706
2333,"00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:31,443"
2334,I understand.
2335,Go ahead.
2336,707
2337,"00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,124"
2338,Baumgart--
2339,Donald Baumgart.
2340,708
2341,"00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:49,294"
2342,It's a fascinating part.
2343,709
2344,"00:35:49,336 --> 00:35:51,212"
2345,He'll really be noticed this time.
2346,710
2347,"00:35:51,254 --> 00:35:52,881"
2348,He also has an offer for a lead
2349,711
2350,"00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:55,258"
2351,"in a television series, Miami"
2352,Beach.
2353,712
2354,"00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,385"
2355,He's suddenly very hot.
2356,713
2357,"00:35:57,385 --> 00:36:00,930"
2358,Mm-hmm. I understand why
2359,you're so overjoyed.
2360,714
2361,"00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:04,517"
2362,"Well, it's a difficult"
2363,period in his life.
2364,715
2365,"00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:05,477"
2366,A challenge.
2367,716
2368,"00:36:06,645 --> 00:36:07,979"
2369,I see.
2370,717
2371,"00:36:08,021 --> 00:36:09,230"
2372,You know how actors are.
2373,718
2374,"00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,399"
2375,They're all a bit self-centered.
2376,719
2377,"00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:13,068"
2378,I'll bet even Laurence Olivier
2379,720
2380,"00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:14,694"
2381,is vain and self-centered.
2382,721
2383,"00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:18,740"
2384,It's a difficult part.
2385,722
2386,"00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,200"
2387,"He's got to work with crutches,"
2388,723
2389,"00:36:20,241 --> 00:36:23,078"
2390,"and, naturally, he's preoccupied."
2391,724
2392,"00:36:23,912 --> 00:36:25,080"
2393,And he--
2394,725
2395,"00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:27,290"
2396,"Well, preoccupied."
2397,726
2398,"00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:32,587"
2399,I see you had another suicide
2400,up there at happy house.
2401,727
2402,"00:36:32,587 --> 00:36:34,381"
2403,"Oh, didn't I tell you?"
2404,728
2405,"00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:35,423"
2406,"No, you didn't."
2407,729
2408,"00:36:35,465 --> 00:36:37,509"
2409,"It was that girl I told you about,"
2410,730
2411,"00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,637"
2412,the drug-addict who was rehabilitated
2413,"by this old couple, the Castevets."
2414,731
2415,"00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,263"
2416,I'm sure I told you that.
2417,732
2418,"00:36:42,263 --> 00:36:45,183"
2419,They didn't rehabilitate her
2420,"very successfully, it seems."
2421,733
2422,"00:37:07,122 --> 00:37:08,331"
2423,I've been a creep.
2424,734
2425,"00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:11,626"
2426,It's from worrying if Baumgart
2427,"would regain his sight,"
2428,735
2429,"00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:12,752"
2430,rat that I am.
2431,736
2432,"00:37:12,794 --> 00:37:14,003"
2433,"Oh, it's natural."
2434,737
2435,"00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:15,630"
2436,You're bound to feel two ways about it.
2437,738
2438,"00:37:15,672 --> 00:37:17,882"
2439,Even if I'm Mr. Yamaha
2440,"for the rest of my days,"
2441,739
2442,"00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:19,467"
2443,I'm going to stop giving you
2444,the short end of the stick.
2445,740
2446,"00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:20,552"
2447,You haven't been.
2448,741
2449,"00:37:20,593 --> 00:37:22,053"
2450,"Yes, I have."
2451,742
2452,"00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:24,305"
2453,I've been tearing my hair
2454,out over my career.
2455,743
2456,"00:37:24,347 --> 00:37:27,142"
2457,Let's have a baby.
2458,All right?
2459,744
2460,"00:37:27,142 --> 00:37:29,310"
2461,"Let's have three babies,"
2462,"one at a time, all right?"
2463,745
2464,"00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:31,479"
2465,A baby. You know.
2466,746
2467,"00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:33,565"
2468,"Mama, Dada, poo-poo."
2469,You know?
2470,747
2471,"00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:34,774"
2472,You mean it?
2473,748
2474,"00:37:34,816 --> 00:37:35,942"
2475,"Sure, I mean it."
2476,749
2477,"00:37:35,984 --> 00:37:37,902"
2478,"I mean, I even figured out"
2479,"the right time to start,"
2480,750
2481,"00:37:37,944 --> 00:37:39,154"
2482,look.
2483,751
2484,"00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,490"
2485,"You mean it, really?"
2486,752
2487,"00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,701"
2488,"No, I'm kidding."
2489,"Sure, I mean it."
2490,753
2491,"00:37:46,536 --> 00:37:48,955"
2492,"Oh, Ro, honey, for God's"
2493,"sake, don't cry."
2494,754
2495,"00:37:48,997 --> 00:37:50,415"
2496,I won't. I won't.
2497,755
2498,"00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:51,416"
2499,"Ha, ha, ha."
2500,756
2501,"00:37:56,171 --> 00:37:57,464"
2502,Here goes nothing.
2503,757
2504,"00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:10,894"
2505,The paint!
2506,758
2507,"00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:12,520"
2508,The paint!
2509,759
2510,"00:38:12,562 --> 00:38:13,563"
2511,Good grief.
2512,760
2513,"00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:25,575"
2514,"Nobody, but nobody has a fire tonight."
2515,761
2516,"00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,958"
2517,Isn't it gorgeous?
2518,762
2519,"00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,752"
2520,I hope we have the coldest winter ever.
2521,763
2522,"00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:53,394"
2523,"Oh, shit!"
2524,764
2525,"00:39:00,735 --> 00:39:02,403"
2526,"Hi, Guy!"
2527,765
2528,"00:39:02,403 --> 00:39:03,196"
2529,How are ya?
2530,766
2531,"00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:05,031"
2532,"No, don't let her in."
2533,767
2534,"00:39:05,073 --> 00:39:06,783"
2535,Not tonight.
2536,768
2537,"00:39:06,825 --> 00:39:07,784"
2538,"Oh, that's very kind of you."
2539,769
2540,"00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,873"
2541,"Oh, are you sure"
2542,770
2543,"00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:14,499"
2544,you don't want to come in?
2545,771
2546,"00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,501"
2547,No! I don't want to bother you.
2548,772
2549,"00:39:19,587 --> 00:39:20,630"
2550,Good.
2551,773
2552,"00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:24,384"
2553,Good.
2554,774
2555,"00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:26,594"
2556,Who says there's nothing to E.S.P.?
2557,775
2558,"00:39:26,636 --> 00:39:29,430"
2559,Madame and monsieur shall have
2560,ze dessert after all!
2561,776
2562,"00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,849"
2563,Mousse au chocolat.
2564,777
2565,"00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,309"
2566,Or as Minnie calls it--
2567,chocolate mouse.
2568,778
2569,"00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:36,938"
2570,I was afraid she'd stay all evening.
2571,779
2572,"00:39:36,938 --> 00:39:39,065"
2573,She just wanted us to try it.
2574,780
2575,"00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:41,568"
2576,Seein' it's one of her specialities.
2577,781
2578,"00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:43,152"
2579,"It was sweet of her, really."
2580,782
2581,"00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:44,654"
2582,We shouldn't make fun of her.
2583,783
2584,"00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:45,655"
2585,"Yeah, you're right, you're"
2586,"right, you're right."
2587,784
2588,"00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,545"
2589,Mmm! It's good.
2590,785
2591,"00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:17,645"
2592,Has an undertaste.
2593,786
2594,"00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:20,982"
2595,A chalky undertaste.
2596,787
2597,"00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:24,569"
2598,I don't get it.
2599,788
2600,"00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:27,405"
2601,"That's silly, honey."
2602,789
2603,"00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:29,073"
2604,There is no undertaste.
2605,790
2606,"00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:29,991"
2607,There is.
2608,791
2609,"00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:34,162"
2610,Come on. The old bat slaved all day.
2611,Now eat it.
2612,792
2613,"00:40:34,162 --> 00:40:35,246"
2614,I don't like it.
2615,793
2616,"00:40:35,288 --> 00:40:36,581"
2617,It's delicious.
2618,794
2619,"00:40:36,623 --> 00:40:38,750"
2620,Here.
2621,You can have mine.
2622,795
2623,"00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:40,501"
2624,All right. Don't eat it.
2625,There's always something wrong.
2626,796
2627,"00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,297"
2628,"Oh, if it's going to turn"
2629,into a big thing--
2630,797
2631,"00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:46,257"
2632,"Look, if you really can't stand"
2633,"it, just don't eat it."
2634,798
2635,"00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:49,719"
2636,Mmm! It's delicious!
2637,No undertaste at all.
2638,799
2639,"00:40:52,221 --> 00:40:53,932"
2640,"Would you turn the record over, please?"
2641,800
2642,"00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,907"
2643,"There, Daddy, do I get a gold star?"
2644,801
2645,"00:41:10,949 --> 00:41:11,908"
2646,You get two of them.
2647,802
2648,"00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:14,118"
2649,I'm sorry if I was stuffy.
2650,803
2651,"00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,329"
2652,You were.
2653,804
2654,"00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:17,580"
2655,...Is making a full circle
2656,of the ball park...
2657,805
2658,"00:41:17,622 --> 00:41:20,041"
2659,It's the pope at Yankee Stadium!
2660,806
2661,"00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,584"
2662,...to his specially built
2663,canopy at second base.
2664,807
2665,"00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:22,919"
2666,"Christ, what a mob!"
2667,808
2668,"00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:24,712"
2669,Listen to that crowd roar.
2670,809
2671,"00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:26,297"
2672,"Everywhere the pope has been today,"
2673,810
2674,"00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:28,633"
2675,he's received this type of reception.
2676,811
2677,"00:41:28,675 --> 00:41:30,718"
2678,"As one man put it this afternoon,"
2679,812
2680,"00:41:30,718 --> 00:41:32,553"
2681,"Perhaps we are being undignified,

813
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,597
but this is a special day."
2682,814
2683,"00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,391"
2684,And a special day it has been.
2685,815
2686,"00:41:36,432 --> 00:41:39,143"
2687,That's a great spot for
2688,my Yamaha commercial.
2689,816
2690,"00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:40,103"
2691,"Ha, ha, hal"
2692,817
2693,"00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:44,732"
2694,I'd like to give you a brief summary
2695,of today's historic happenings.
2696,818
2697,"00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:47,694"
2698,Pope Paul VI arrived at 9:27 A.M...
2699,819
2700,"00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:50,905"
2701,What is it?
2702,820
2703,"00:41:52,615 --> 00:41:53,700"
2704,Dizzy.
2705,821
2706,"00:41:58,746 --> 00:41:59,747"
2707,Hey.
2708,822
2709,"00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:03,793"
2710,No wonder.
2711,823
2712,"00:42:04,293 --> 00:42:05,545"
2713,All that booze.
2714,824
2715,"00:42:06,045 --> 00:42:07,505"
2716,"Ha, ha."
2717,825
2718,"00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:09,424"
2719,You didn't eat anything all
2720,"day before dinner, huh?"
2721,826
2722,"00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:16,431"
2723,Hey.
2724,827
2725,"00:42:17,765 --> 00:42:18,891"
2726,Hey.
2727,828
2728,"00:42:41,831 --> 00:42:43,207"
2729,Nice.
2730,829
2731,"00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:44,959"
2732,Sleep is what you need.
2733,830
2734,"00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:45,960"
2735,A good night's sleep.
2736,831
2737,"00:42:47,462 --> 00:42:49,297"
2738,We have to make a baby.
2739,832
2740,"00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:51,883"
2741,"Oh, we'll--"
2742,we'll do it.
2743,833
2744,"00:42:53,342 --> 00:42:55,011"
2745,Tomorrow.
2746,There's plenty of time.
2747,834
2748,"00:42:56,262 --> 00:42:57,472"
2749,Just a nap.
2750,835
2751,"00:43:36,177 --> 00:43:37,512"
2752,Why are you taking them off?
2753,836
2754,"00:43:38,387 --> 00:43:39,680"
2755,To make you more comfortable.
2756,837
2757,"00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,891"
2758,I am more comfortable.
2759,838
2760,"00:43:42,892 --> 00:43:44,060"
2761,"Sleep, Ro."
2762,839
2763,"00:44:24,767 --> 00:44:26,227"
2764,Isn't Hutch coming with us?
2765,840
2766,"00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:29,480"
2767,"Catholics only,"
2768,841
2769,"00:44:29,522 --> 00:44:32,650"
2770,I wish we weren't bound
2771,"by these prejudices,"
2772,842
2773,"00:44:32,692 --> 00:44:34,235"
2774,"but, unfortunately--"
2775,843
2776,"00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:21,449"
2777,"Easy, easy."
2778,844
2779,"00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:23,075"
2780,You got her too high.
2781,845
2782,"00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:25,786"
2783,Typhoon!
2784,Typhoon!
2785,846
2786,"00:45:25,828 --> 00:45:28,539"
2787,"It killed 55 people in London,"
2788,847
2789,"00:45:28,581 --> 00:45:30,124"
2790,and it's heading this way!
2791,848
2792,"00:45:37,298 --> 00:45:38,925"
2793,"You better go down below, miss."
2794,849
2795,"00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,282"
2796,She's awake.
2797,She sees.
2798,850
2799,"00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:45,741"
2800,She don't see.
2801,851
2802,"00:46:45,783 --> 00:46:46,909"
2803,"As long as she ate the mouse,"
2804,she can't see nor hear.
2805,852
2806,"00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:48,202"
2807,She's like dead.
2808,Now sing.
2809,853
2810,"00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,881"
2811,I'm sorry to hear
2812,854
2813,"00:47:00,881 --> 00:47:01,382"
2814,you aren't feeling well.
2815,855
2816,"00:47:02,883 --> 00:47:04,385"
2817,It's only the mouse bite.
2818,856
2819,"00:47:05,594 --> 00:47:07,596"
2820,You'd better have your legs tied down
2821,857
2822,"00:47:07,638 --> 00:47:09,223"
2823,in case of convulsions.
2824,858
2825,"00:47:10,516 --> 00:47:11,934"
2826,"Yes, I suppose so."
2827,859
2828,"00:47:13,728 --> 00:47:15,771"
2829,There's always a chance it was rabid.
2830,860
2831,"00:47:15,813 --> 00:47:17,398"
2832,"If the music bothers you,"
2833,861
2834,"00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,276"
2835,"let me know, and I'll have"
2836,it stopped.
2837,862
2838,"00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:22,069"
2839,"Oh, no, no, no."
2840,863
2841,"00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:24,739"
2842,Please don't change the
2843,program on my account.
2844,864
2845,"00:47:25,406 --> 00:47:26,365"
2846,Try to sleep.
2847,865
2848,"00:47:27,408 --> 00:47:29,285"
2849,We'll be waiting up on deck.
2850,866
2851,"00:48:07,948 --> 00:48:10,159"
2852,This is no dream!
2853,This is really happening!
2854,867
2855,"00:48:20,086 --> 00:48:22,838"
2856,They tell me you have
2857,been bitten by a mouse.
2858,868
2859,"00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,925"
2860,Yes. That's why I couldn't
2861,come to see you.
2862,869
2863,"00:48:25,966 --> 00:48:27,927"
2864,That's all right.
2865,870
2866,"00:48:27,968 --> 00:48:29,345"
2867,We wouldn't want you to
2868,jeopardize your health.
2869,871
2870,"00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:34,183"
2871,"Am I forgiven, Father?"
2872,872
2873,"00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:35,476"
2874,"Oh, absolutely."
2875,873
2876,"00:48:49,532 --> 00:48:51,200"
2877,"Hey, it's after 9:00."
2878,874
2879,"00:48:53,452 --> 00:48:54,495"
2880,Uhm.
2881,875
2882,"00:48:56,914 --> 00:48:58,249"
2883,Five minutes.
2884,876
2885,"00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,209"
2886,I have to be at Alan's at 10:00.
2887,877
2888,"00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:03,337"
2889,Eat out.
2890,878
2891,"00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:04,505"
2892,Like hell I will.
2893,879
2894,"00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:16,934"
2895,What time is it?
2896,880
2897,"00:49:16,976 --> 00:49:18,519"
2898,It's 10 after 9:00.
2899,881
2900,"00:49:20,813 --> 00:49:22,481"
2901,What time did I go to sleep?
2902,882
2903,"00:49:22,523 --> 00:49:23,899"
2904,You didn't go to sleep.
2905,883
2906,"00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:26,068"
2907,You passed out.
2908,884
2909,"00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:28,863"
2910,"From now on you get cocktails or wine,"
2911,885
2912,"00:49:28,863 --> 00:49:30,364"
2913,not cocktails and
2914,"wine, hmm?"
2915,886
2916,"00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:33,075"
2917,The dreams I had.
2918,887
2919,"00:49:37,705 --> 00:49:38,998"
2920,Don't yell.
2921,888
2922,"00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:40,249"
2923,I already filed them down.
2924,889
2925,"00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,045"
2926,I didn't want to miss baby night.
2927,890
2928,"00:49:45,045 --> 00:49:46,005"
2929,A couple of my nails were ragged.
2930,891
2931,"00:49:46,046 --> 00:49:47,840"
2932,You-- While I was out?
2933,892
2934,"00:49:47,882 --> 00:49:50,968"
2935,"And it was kind of fun, in"
2936,"a ""necrophile” sort of way."
2937,893
2938,"00:49:54,138 --> 00:49:57,183"
2939,I dreamed someone was raping me.
2940,894
2941,"00:49:57,975 --> 00:49:59,852"
2942,"I don't know, someone inhuman."
2943,895
2944,"00:49:59,894 --> 00:50:01,145"
2945,Thanks a lot!
2946,896
2947,"00:50:04,064 --> 00:50:05,232"
2948,What's the matter?
2949,897
2950,"00:50:05,274 --> 00:50:06,317"
2951,Nothing.
2952,898
2953,"00:50:08,777 --> 00:50:10,154"
2954,I didn't want to miss the night.
2955,899
2956,"00:50:11,238 --> 00:50:13,991"
2957,We could've done it this
2958,morning or tonight.
2959,900
2960,"00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:16,368"
2961,Last night wasn't the only split second.
2962,901
2963,"00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,037"
2964,I was a little bit loaded
2965,"myself, you know?"
2966,902
2967,"00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:40,809"
2968,Oh! Hello there.
2969,Did ya like it?
2970,903
2971,"00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:42,311"
2972,"Oh, yes."
2973,904
2974,"00:50:42,353 --> 00:50:44,230"
2975,I think I put a little too
2976,much cream de cocoa in it.
2977,905
2978,"00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:45,689"
2979,"No, no."
2980,It was delicious.
2981,906
2982,"00:50:45,731 --> 00:50:46,649"
2983,You'll have to give me the recipe.
2984,907
2985,"00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:49,109"
2986,"Yeah, love to."
2987,"Oh, listen, you going shopping?"
2988,908
2989,"00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:50,444"
2990,"Do me a teeny favor, will ya?"
2991,909
2992,"00:50:50,444 --> 00:50:53,072"
2993,"Get me six eggs, a small instant Sanka."
2994,I'll pay you later.
2995,910
2996,"00:50:53,781 --> 00:50:54,949"
2997,Right.
2998,Bye-bye.
2999,911
3000,"00:50:55,449 --> 00:50:56,450"
3001,Ahh.
3002,912
3003,"00:51:04,917 --> 00:51:06,502"
3004,Don't you think we ought
3005,to talk about it?
3006,913
3007,"00:51:06,961 --> 00:51:08,128"
3008,About what?
3009,914
3010,"00:51:09,171 --> 00:51:10,673"
3011,The way you haven't been looking at me.
3012,915
3013,"00:51:10,714 --> 00:51:11,882"
3014,What are you talking about?
3015,916
3016,"00:51:11,924 --> 00:51:12,883"
3017,I've been looking at you.
3018,917
3019,"00:51:12,925 --> 00:51:14,385"
3020,You haven't.
3021,918
3022,"00:51:14,426 --> 00:51:15,511"
3023,"Why, sure, I have."
3024,919
3025,"00:51:16,387 --> 00:51:17,513"
3026,"Now, what is it?"
3027,What's the matter?
3028,920
3029,"00:51:20,975 --> 00:51:22,726"
3030,Nothing. Never mind.
3031,921
3032,"00:51:22,768 --> 00:51:23,477"
3033,"No, no."
3034,Don't say that.
3035,922
3036,"00:51:23,477 --> 00:51:23,811"
3037,What is it?
3038,923
3039,"00:51:23,852 --> 00:51:26,480"
3040,Nothing.
3041,924
3042,"00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,399"
3043,"Look, honey, I--"
3044,925
3045,"00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,609"
3046,I know I've been preoccupied
3047,"with the part and all,"
3048,926
3049,"00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:32,152"
3050,but it is important.
3051,927
3052,"00:51:32,152 --> 00:51:33,612"
3053,That doesn't mean I don't love you.
3054,928
3055,"00:51:48,794 --> 00:51:50,254"
3056,It was due on Friday.
3057,929
3058,"00:51:52,298 --> 00:51:53,340"
3059,It was?
3060,930
3061,"00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,550"
3062,Mm-hmm.
3063,931
3064,"00:51:55,884 --> 00:51:57,428"
3065,It'll probably come tonight or tomorrow.
3066,932
3067,"00:51:57,469 --> 00:51:59,096"
3068,Wanna bet?
3069,Yeah.
3070,933
3071,"00:51:59,138 --> 00:52:00,180"
3072,A quarter.
3073,Okay.
3074,934
3075,"00:52:00,222 --> 00:52:01,599"
3076,You're going to lose.
3077,935
3078,"00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,143"
3079,"Shut up, will you?"
3080,You're getting me all jumpy.
3081,936
3082,"00:52:04,184 --> 00:52:06,020"
3083,It's only been two days.
3084,937
3085,"00:52:06,478 --> 00:52:07,396"
3086,When will I know?
3087,938
3088,"00:52:08,522 --> 00:52:10,816"
3089,I'll call you just as soon
3090,as I get the results.
3091,939
3092,"00:52:10,858 --> 00:52:12,568"
3093,I like to do a general examination
3094,940
3095,"00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:14,320"
3096,just to know something more.
3097,941
3098,"00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,866"
3099,It was Elise Dunstan who recommended
3100,"you to me, Doctor."
3101,942
3102,"00:52:18,907 --> 00:52:20,409"
3103,"Oh, yes."
3104,How is she?
3105,943
3106,"00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:22,620"
3107,She's fine.
3108,And the boys are great.
3109,944
3110,"00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,704"
3111,Did you deliver them?
3112,945
3113,"00:52:23,746 --> 00:52:25,289"
3114,"No, just the last."
3115,946
3116,"00:52:25,331 --> 00:52:26,540"
3117,Universal hemoglobin.
3118,947
3119,"00:52:26,582 --> 00:52:28,125"
3120,"Yes, Doctor."
3121,948
3122,"00:52:41,513 --> 00:52:42,931"
3123,We went to see The Fantasticks.
3124,949
3125,"00:52:42,973 --> 00:52:44,183"
3126,Did you?
3127,950
3128,"00:52:44,224 --> 00:52:45,559"
3129,Mmm.
3130,Did you enjoy it?
3131,951
3132,"00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:46,769"
3133,Yeah.
3134,952
3135,"00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,062"
3136,Good.
3137,953
3138,"00:52:53,776 --> 00:52:55,069"
3139,Hello?
3140,954
3141,"00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,236"
3142,Mrs. Woodhouse?
3143,955
3144,"00:52:56,236 --> 00:52:58,072"
3145,Dr. Hill?
3146,Congratulations.
3147,956
3148,"00:52:58,572 --> 00:52:59,740"
3149,Really?
3150,957
3151,"00:52:59,782 --> 00:53:01,033"
3152,Really.
3153,958
3154,"00:53:03,035 --> 00:53:04,411"
3155,Are you there?
3156,959
3157,"00:53:04,411 --> 00:53:07,790"
3158,"Uh, yes, um, what happens now?"
3159,960
3160,"00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:09,541"
3161,You come see me next month.
3162,961
3163,"00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:12,044"
3164,You get those natalin pills.
3165,One a day.
3166,962
3167,"00:53:12,086 --> 00:53:13,712"
3168,I'll mail you forms for the hospital.
3169,963
3170,"00:53:13,754 --> 00:53:15,714"
3171,"Uh, when will it be?"
3172,964
3173,"00:53:15,756 --> 00:53:18,092"
3174,It works out to be June 28th.
3175,965
3176,"00:53:18,092 --> 00:53:19,927"
3177,That sounds so far away.
3178,966
3179,"00:53:19,927 --> 00:53:21,512"
3180,Itis.
3181,967
3182,"00:53:21,553 --> 00:53:22,888"
3183,"One more thing, Mrs. Woodhouse,"
3184,968
3185,"00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,306"
3186,we'd like another blood sample.
3187,969
3188,"00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:25,974"
3189,"Oh, yes, of course."
3190,970
3191,"00:53:26,016 --> 00:53:27,893"
3192,What for?
3193,971
3194,"00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,895"
3195,"The nurse didn't take enough,"
3196,972
3197,"00:53:29,937 --> 00:53:31,355"
3198,so would you drop by and see her?
3199,973
3200,"00:53:31,397 --> 00:53:33,857"
3201,"But I am pregnant, aren't I?"
3202,974
3203,"00:53:33,899 --> 00:53:35,109"
3204,"Oh, yes, it's just for blood samp--"
3205,975
3206,"00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,777"
3207,Blood sugar and so forth.
3208,976
3209,"00:53:36,819 --> 00:53:39,363"
3210,But you're pregnant.
3211,Don't worry.
3212,977
3213,"00:53:39,405 --> 00:53:42,116"
3214,All right.
3215,"Well, I'll come in on Monday."
3216,978
3217,"00:53:42,116 --> 00:53:43,367"
3218,All right.
3219,Don't forget the pills.
3220,979
3221,"00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:44,618"
3222,"No, I won't."
3223,980
3224,"00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,245"
3225,"Good-bye, Mrs. Woodhouse."
3226,"Good-bye, Dr. Hill."
3227,981
3228,"00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:49,790"
3229,Blood sugar?
3230,982
3231,"00:54:06,682 --> 00:54:07,558"
3232,What's that?
3233,983
3234,"00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:14,148"
3235,Oh! That's great.
3236,That's just great.
3237,984
3238,"00:54:14,815 --> 00:54:15,983"
3239,Father.
3240,985
3241,"00:54:15,983 --> 00:54:17,818"
3242,Mother.
3243,"Heh, heh."
3244,986
3245,"00:54:18,819 --> 00:54:21,488"
3246,"Guy, Guy, listen."
3247,987
3248,"00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:24,658"
3249,"Let's, uh, make this"
3250,"a new beginning, okay?"
3251,988
3252,"00:54:24,658 --> 00:54:26,452"
3253,"A new openness in talking to each other,"
3254,989
3255,"00:54:26,493 --> 00:54:28,829"
3256,because we haven't been open.
3257,990
3258,"00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:32,291"
3259,That's true.
3260,I've been so goddamned self-centered.
3261,991
3262,"00:54:32,332 --> 00:54:34,251"
3263,That's what the whole trouble is.
3264,992
3265,"00:54:34,293 --> 00:54:35,878"
3266,"You know I love you, don't you, Ro?"
3267,993
3268,"00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:37,337"
3269,I do.
3270,I swear to God
3271,994
3272,"00:54:37,379 --> 00:54:38,964"
3273,I'm going to be as open and--
3274,995
3275,"00:54:39,006 --> 00:54:40,174"
3276,It's my fault as much as yours.
3277,996
3278,"00:54:40,174 --> 00:54:42,092"
3279,"No, bull, it's mine."
3280,Now you bear with me.
3281,997
3282,"00:54:42,134 --> 00:54:43,635"
3283,"I'm gonna try and do better, you hear?"
3284,998
3285,"00:54:43,677 --> 00:54:45,304"
3286,"Oh, Guy."
3287,999
3288,"00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,772"
3289,"Ha, ha, ha."
3290,1000
3291,"00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:56,356"
3292,What?
3293,1001
3294,"00:54:56,398 --> 00:54:57,691"
3295,It's...
3296,1002
3297,"00:54:57,733 --> 00:55:00,652"
3298,a fine way for parents
3299,to be carrying on.
3300,1003
3301,"00:55:00,694 --> 00:55:02,488"
3302,Hey.
3303,1004
3304,"00:55:02,529 --> 00:55:03,781"
3305,Know what I'd love to do?
3306,1005
3307,"00:55:03,822 --> 00:55:05,282"
3308,What?
3309,1006
3310,"00:55:05,324 --> 00:55:06,992"
3311,Tell Minnie and Roman.
3312,1007
3313,"00:55:07,034 --> 00:55:08,619"
3314,"Oh, I know, I know."
3315,1008
3316,"00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,579"
3317,"It's, uh--"
3318,1009
3319,"00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:13,165"
3320,"It's, uh, supposed to be"
3321,"a deep, dark secret,"
3322,1010
3323,"00:55:13,207 --> 00:55:16,668"
3324,but I already told them
3325,that we were trying.
3326,1011
3327,"00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:17,795"
3328,They were so pleased.
3329,1012
3330,"00:55:19,171 --> 00:55:20,881"
3331,Tell them.
3332,1013
3333,"00:55:20,923 --> 00:55:22,049"
3334,Back in two minutes?
3335,1014
3336,"00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,342"
3337,Mm-hmm.
3338,1015
3339,"00:55:33,894 --> 00:55:35,395"
3340,You're pregnant.
3341,1016
3342,"00:55:38,857 --> 00:55:39,733"
3343,Another blood sample.
3344,1017
3345,"00:55:40,067 --> 00:55:41,443"
3346,Ta-da!
3347,1018
3348,"00:55:41,485 --> 00:55:44,863"
3349,"Now, that's what I call good news!"
3350,1019
3351,"00:55:44,905 --> 00:55:47,658"
3352,"Aw, honey, congratulations."
3353,1020
3354,"00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:49,243"
3355,Thank you.
3356,1021
3357,"00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:50,744"
3358,"Best wishes, Rosemary."
3359,1022
3360,"00:55:50,744 --> 00:55:52,037"
3361,Thank you very much.
3362,1023
3363,"00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,539"
3364,We are more pleased than we can say.
3365,1024
3366,"00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,165"
3367,"We didn't have any champagne on hand,"
3368,1025
3369,"00:55:55,207 --> 00:55:56,708"
3370,but this will do just as nicely.
3371,1026
3372,"00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,210"
3373,"When are you due, dear?"
3374,1027
3375,"00:55:58,585 --> 00:55:59,920"
3376,June 28th.
3377,1028
3378,"00:55:59,962 --> 00:56:01,421"
3379,"Oh, that'll be so exciting."
3380,1029
3381,"00:56:01,463 --> 00:56:02,798"
3382,"Listen, dear, you got a good doctor?"
3383,1030
3384,"00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,299"
3385,"Oh, yes, a very good one."
3386,1031
3387,"00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:06,134"
3388,One of the top obstetricians
3389,1032
3390,"00:56:06,176 --> 00:56:08,053"
3391,is a dear friend of
3392,"ours, Abe Sapirstein."
3393,1033
3394,"00:56:08,095 --> 00:56:09,888"
3395,Delivers all the society babies.
3396,1034
3397,"00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,306"
3398,Abe Sapirstein?
3399,1035
3400,"00:56:11,348 --> 00:56:13,600"
3401,One of the finest obstetricians
3402,in the country.
3403,1036
3404,"00:56:13,642 --> 00:56:15,269"
3405,Wasn't he on Open End
3406,a couple of years ago?
3407,1037
3408,"00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,770"
3409,That's right.
3410,1038
3411,"00:56:16,812 --> 00:56:17,896"
3412,Ro?
3413,1039
3414,"00:56:17,938 --> 00:56:19,356"
3415,Uh--
3416,1040
3417,"00:56:19,398 --> 00:56:21,191"
3418,"Well, what about Dr. Hill?"
3419,1041
3420,"00:56:21,233 --> 00:56:22,818"
3421,Don't worry about Hill.
3422,I'll tell him something.
3423,1042
3424,"00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,361"
3425,You know me.
3426,1043
3427,"00:56:24,403 --> 00:56:26,196"
3428,"Listen, I won't let you"
3429,go to no Dr. Hill
3430,1044
3431,"00:56:26,238 --> 00:56:27,531"
3432,nobody ever heard of.
3433,1045
3434,"00:56:27,573 --> 00:56:29,908"
3435,The best is what you're going
3436,"to have, young lady."
3437,1046
3438,"00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,243"
3439,"Where's your telephone, huh?"
3440,1047
3441,"00:56:31,285 --> 00:56:32,744"
3442,It's in the bedroom.
3443,1048
3444,"00:56:32,786 --> 00:56:35,289"
3445,He's a brilliant man.
3446,Very sensitive.
3447,1049
3448,"00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:37,082"
3449,"Ro, sit down, sit down."
3450,1050
3451,"00:56:37,124 --> 00:56:38,542"
3452,"No, I'm fine."
3453,1051
3454,"00:56:38,584 --> 00:56:41,336"
3455,"Abe, Minnie."
3456,Fine.
3457,1052
3458,"00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:42,671"
3459,"Listen, Abe, a dear friend of ours"
3460,1053
3461,"00:56:42,713 --> 00:56:44,923"
3462,Just found out today she's pregnant.
3463,1054
3464,"00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:46,675"
3465,"Yeah, isn't it?"
3466,I'm in her apartment right now.
3467,1055
3468,"00:56:47,759 --> 00:56:50,095"
3469,We told her you'd be glad
3470,to take care of her.
3471,1056
3472,"00:56:50,137 --> 00:56:52,598"
3473,You wouldn't charge her none of your
3474,fancy society prices neither.
3475,1057
3476,"00:56:53,307 --> 00:56:55,309"
3477,"Well, just wait a minute."
3478,1058
3479,"00:56:55,309 --> 00:56:56,560"
3480,"Rosemary, tomorrow morning at 11:00?"
3481,1059
3482,"00:56:56,977 --> 00:56:58,353"
3483,All right.
3484,1060
3485,"00:56:58,395 --> 00:57:00,856"
3486,"Yeah, 11:00's fine, Abe."
3487,Uh-huh.
3488,1061
3489,"00:57:00,898 --> 00:57:02,900"
3490,"Yeah, well, you, too."
3491,1062
3492,"00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:05,193"
3493,"No, no, no, no, not at all."
3494,1063
3495,"00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:06,820"
3496,All right.
3497,"Well, let's hope so."
3498,1064
3499,"00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,571"
3500,Good-bye.
3501,1065
3502,"00:57:08,155 --> 00:57:10,282"
3503,"Well, there you are."
3504,1066
3505,"00:57:10,324 --> 00:57:11,575"
3506,"Thanks a million, Minnie."
3507,1067
3508,"00:57:11,617 --> 00:57:13,785"
3509,I don't know how to thank
3510,"you, both of you."
3511,1068
3512,"00:57:13,827 --> 00:57:16,371"
3513,"Just have a fine, healthy"
3514,"baby, that's all."
3515,1069
3516,"00:57:16,413 --> 00:57:19,207"
3517,"My, I can't wait to tell Laura-Louise."
3518,1070
3519,"00:57:19,249 --> 00:57:21,335"
3520,Oh--
3521,1071
3522,"00:57:21,376 --> 00:57:24,087"
3523,"Uh, please don't tell anyone"
3524,"else, not right away."
3525,1072
3526,"00:57:24,129 --> 00:57:25,380"
3527,"No, she's right."
3528,1073
3529,"00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:27,174"
3530,There's plenty of time.
3531,1074
3532,"00:57:27,174 --> 00:57:29,760"
3533,"Now, to a fine, healthy baby."
3534,1075
3535,"00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:30,802"
3536,"Hear, hear."
3537,1076
3538,"00:57:30,844 --> 00:57:31,845"
3539,Hear!
3540,1077
3541,"00:57:33,555 --> 00:57:34,848"
3542,Andy.
3543,1078
3544,"00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:38,852"
3545,Or Susan.
3546,1079
3547,"00:57:40,187 --> 00:57:41,688"
3548,Susan.
3549,1080
3550,"00:58:27,526 --> 00:58:30,320"
3551,Please don't read books.
3552,1081
3553,"00:58:30,362 --> 00:58:33,407"
3554,No pregnancy was ever exactly like
3555,the ones described in the books.
3556,1082
3557,"00:58:34,616 --> 00:58:37,327"
3558,And don't listen to
3559,"your friends, either."
3560,1083
3561,"00:58:37,369 --> 00:58:38,996"
3562,No two pregnancies are ever alike.
3563,1084
3564,"00:58:40,664 --> 00:58:42,416"
3565,Dr. Hill prescribed vitamin pills.
3566,1085
3567,"00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:44,251"
3568,No pills.
3569,1086
3570,"00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:47,421"
3571,Minnie Castevet has a herbarium.
3572,1087
3573,"00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:49,006"
3574,I'm going to have her make
3575,a daily drink for you
3576,1088
3577,"00:58:49,047 --> 00:58:51,550"
3578,"that'll be fresher, safer,"
3579,and more vitamin-rich
3580,1089
3581,"00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:52,843"
3582,than any pills on the market.
3583,1090
3584,"00:58:55,053 --> 00:58:57,764"
3585,"Any questions you have,"
3586,call me night or day.
3587,1091
3588,"00:58:57,806 --> 00:58:59,349"
3589,"Call me, not your Aunt Fanny."
3590,1092
3591,"00:58:59,391 --> 00:59:00,267"
3592,That's what I'm here for.
3593,1093
3594,"00:59:00,308 --> 00:59:01,977"
3595,Here.
3596,1094
3597,"00:59:02,019 --> 00:59:03,437"
3598,What's in it?
3599,1095
3600,"00:59:03,478 --> 00:59:06,565"
3601,"Snips and snails and puppy dogs"" tails."
3602,1096
3603,"00:59:06,606 --> 00:59:08,316"
3604,"That's fine, but what if we"
3605,want a girl?
3606,1097
3607,"00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:10,527"
3608,Do you?
3609,1098
3610,"00:59:10,569 --> 00:59:12,320"
3611,It would be nice if the
3612,first one were a boy.
3613,1099
3614,"00:59:12,362 --> 00:59:13,947"
3615,"Well, there you are."
3616,1100
3617,"00:59:17,325 --> 00:59:19,036"
3618,"No, really, what is"
3619,init?
3620,1101
3621,"00:59:19,077 --> 00:59:21,455"
3622,"A raw egg, gelatin, herbs."
3623,1102
3624,"00:59:21,496 --> 00:59:23,373"
3625,Tannis root?
3626,1103
3627,"00:59:23,415 --> 00:59:26,126"
3628,Some of that along with
3629,some other things.
3630,1104
3631,"00:59:26,168 --> 00:59:29,171"
3632,"Don't be so violent, Harry."
3633,"If you want to be stupid,"
3634,1105
3635,"00:59:29,212 --> 00:59:30,922"
3636,"be nonviolent stupid,"
3637,1106
3638,"00:59:31,631 --> 00:59:33,216"
3639,I'm in love with no one.
3640,1107
3641,"00:59:33,258 --> 00:59:34,634"
3642,Especially not your fat wife.
3643,1108
3644,"00:59:35,635 --> 00:59:37,137"
3645,I'm a hopeless cripple--
3646,1109
3647,"00:59:39,473 --> 00:59:40,599"
3648,What's that?
3649,1110
3650,"00:59:42,225 --> 00:59:44,478"
3651,I-I've been to Vidal Sassoon.
3652,1111
3653,"00:59:45,312 --> 00:59:46,688"
3654,Don't tell me you paid for that.
3655,1112
3656,"00:59:48,482 --> 00:59:50,942"
3657,"Guy, I have a pain."
3658,1113
3659,"00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:52,652"
3660,Where?
3661,1114
3662,"00:59:52,652 --> 00:59:54,029"
3663,Here.
3664,1115
3665,"00:59:54,071 --> 00:59:55,197"
3666,Just now?
3667,1116
3668,"00:59:55,238 --> 00:59:56,531"
3669,Since Monday.
3670,1117
3671,"00:59:57,199 --> 00:59:58,533"
3672,A sharp pain.
3673,1118
3674,"00:59:58,575 --> 01:00:00,118"
3675,Did you see Sapirstein?
3676,1119
3677,"01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,328"
3678,I'm seeing him on Wednesday.
3679,1120
3680,"01:00:01,328 --> 01:00:02,496"
3681,This is ridiculous.
3682,1121
3683,"01:00:02,537 --> 01:00:04,372"
3684,Why don't you see Sapirstein?
3685,1122
3686,"01:00:04,414 --> 01:00:05,540"
3687,Why didn't you say anything?
3688,1123
3689,"01:00:05,582 --> 01:00:06,875"
3690,I see him Wednesday regular.
3691,1124
3692,"01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,712"
3693,An entirely natural expansion
3694,of the pelvis.
3695,1125
3696,"01:00:10,754 --> 01:00:12,464"
3697,You can fight it with ordinary aspirin.
3698,1126
3699,"01:00:12,506 --> 01:00:14,800"
3700,I was afraid it might be
3701,an ectopic pregnancy.
3702,1127
3703,"01:00:15,133 --> 01:00:17,052"
3704,Ectopic?
3705,1128
3706,"01:00:17,094 --> 01:00:18,970"
3707,I thought you weren't going
3708,"to read books, Rosemary."
3709,1129
3710,"01:00:19,012 --> 01:00:20,680"
3711,It was staring at me in the drugstore.
3712,1130
3713,"01:00:20,722 --> 01:00:22,140"
3714,All it did was worry you.
3715,1131
3716,"01:00:22,182 --> 01:00:24,351"
3717,Will you go home and
3718,"throw it away, please?"
3719,1132
3720,"01:00:24,392 --> 01:00:26,186"
3721,The pains will be gone in two days.
3722,1133
3723,"01:00:27,521 --> 01:00:29,064"
3724,Ectopic pregnancy.
3725,1134
3726,"01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:14,818"
3727,I look awful.
3728,1135
3729,"01:01:15,902 --> 01:01:17,320"
3730,What are you talking about?
3731,1136
3732,"01:01:17,362 --> 01:01:19,406"
3733,You look great.
3734,1137
3735,"01:01:19,406 --> 01:01:20,824"
3736,It's that haircut that looks awful.
3737,1138
3738,"01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,493"
3739,"You want the truth, honey,"
3740,1139
3741,"01:01:23,535 --> 01:01:25,078"
3742,that's the worst mistake you ever made.
3743,1140
3744,"01:02:00,363 --> 01:02:02,157"
3745,My Goa!
3746,1141
3747,"01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:03,950"
3748,It's Vidal Sassoon.
3749,1142
3750,"01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,118"
3751,It's very in.
3752,1143
3753,"01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,703"
3754,What's wrong with you?
3755,1144
3756,"01:02:06,745 --> 01:02:08,330"
3757,Do I look that bad?
3758,1145
3759,"01:02:08,371 --> 01:02:09,956"
3760,Terrible!
3761,1146
3762,"01:02:09,998 --> 01:02:11,791"
3763,You're not on one of those
3764,"Zen diets, are you?"
3765,1147
3766,"01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,126"
3767,No.
3768,1148
3769,"01:02:13,126 --> 01:02:15,128"
3770,Then what is it?
3771,Have you seen a doctor?
3772,1149
3773,"01:02:16,296 --> 01:02:17,505"
3774,"Hutch, I might as well tell you."
3775,1150
3776,"01:02:17,547 --> 01:02:18,632"
3777,I'm pregnant.
3778,1151
3779,"01:02:18,673 --> 01:02:20,634"
3780,"Oh, rubbish."
3781,1152
3782,"01:02:20,634 --> 01:02:23,386"
3783,Pregnant women gain weight.
3784,They don't lose it.
3785,1153
3786,"01:02:23,428 --> 01:02:25,180"
3787,I don't sleep well.
3788,1154
3789,"01:02:25,222 --> 01:02:28,141"
3790,"I have stiff joints or something,"
3791,so I get a pain.
3792,1155
3793,"01:02:28,183 --> 01:02:29,768"
3794,Nothing serious.
3795,1156
3796,"01:02:29,809 --> 01:02:31,603"
3797,"Well, congratulations."
3798,1157
3799,"01:02:32,312 --> 01:02:33,396"
3800,You must be very happy.
3801,1158
3802,"01:02:33,438 --> 01:02:35,148"
3803,"Oh, I am."
3804,We both are.
3805,1159
3806,"01:02:36,149 --> 01:02:38,151"
3807,Who's your obstetrician?
3808,1160
3809,"01:02:38,151 --> 01:02:39,861"
3810,Abraham Sapirstein.
3811,1161
3812,"01:02:39,903 --> 01:02:42,822"
3813,Oh! He delivered two of
3814,my daughter's babies.
3815,1162
3816,"01:02:42,822 --> 01:02:44,699"
3817,He's one of the best in the city.
3818,1163
3819,"01:02:44,741 --> 01:02:46,076"
3820,When did you see him last?
3821,1164
3822,"01:02:46,117 --> 01:02:47,535"
3823,"Um, yesterday."
3824,1165
3825,"01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:48,912"
3826,And?
3827,1166
3828,"01:02:48,954 --> 01:02:50,664"
3829,And he says it's fairly common.
3830,1167
3831,"01:02:52,332 --> 01:02:53,833"
3832,How much weight have you lost?
3833,1168
3834,"01:02:55,335 --> 01:02:57,087"
3835,"Uh, 3 pounds."
3836,1169
3837,"01:02:57,128 --> 01:02:59,005"
3838,Nonsense. You've lost
3839,far more than that.
3840,1170
3841,"01:03:00,215 --> 01:03:02,509"
3842,It's perfectly normal to
3843,lose a little at first.
3844,1171
3845,"01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:04,135"
3846,"Later on, I'll be gaining."
3847,1172
3848,"01:03:04,177 --> 01:03:06,763"
3849,Well...
3850,1173
3851,"01:03:06,805 --> 01:03:09,683"
3852,we must assume Dr. Sapirstein
3853,knows whereof he speaks.
3854,1174
3855,"01:03:09,683 --> 01:03:11,601"
3856,He should.
3857,He charges enough.
3858,1175
3859,"01:03:11,643 --> 01:03:13,520"
3860,We're getting bargain rates.
3861,1176
3862,"01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,771"
3863,Our neighbors are close friends of his.
3864,1177
3865,"01:03:14,813 --> 01:03:16,189"
3866,Oh?
3867,1178
3868,"01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:17,857"
3869,I'll go.
3870,Stay where you are.
3871,1179
3872,"01:03:17,899 --> 01:03:19,276"
3873,It hurts less when I move around.
3874,1180
3875,"01:03:22,862 --> 01:03:24,614"
3876,"Oh, I was just talking about you."
3877,1181
3878,"01:03:24,698 --> 01:03:26,032"
3879,"Favorably, I hope."
3880,1182
3881,"01:03:26,032 --> 01:03:27,784"
3882,Do you need anything from outside?
3883,1183
3884,"01:03:27,826 --> 01:03:29,494"
3885,No. Thank you for asking.
3886,1184
3887,"01:03:29,536 --> 01:03:31,413"
3888,Is Guy home already?
3889,1185
3890,"01:03:31,454 --> 01:03:32,872"
3891,He won't be home till 6:00.
3892,1186
3893,"01:03:32,914 --> 01:03:34,249"
3894,Oh.
3895,1187
3896,"01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:35,709"
3897,A friend of ours is here.
3898,1188
3899,"01:03:37,043 --> 01:03:38,628"
3900,Would you--
3901,Would you like to meet him?
3902,1189
3903,"01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:40,422"
3904,If I won't be intruding.
3905,1190
3906,"01:03:40,463 --> 01:03:41,881"
3907,No. Please come in.
3908,1191
3909,"01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,438"
3910,"Hutch, this is Roman Castevet."
3911,1192
3912,"01:03:56,479 --> 01:03:57,939"
3913,Edward Hutchins.
3914,1193
3915,"01:03:57,981 --> 01:03:59,899"
3916,How do you do?
3917,"Oh, how are you, sir?"
3918,1194
3919,"01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:01,735"
3920,I was just telling Hutch
3921,that it was you and Minnie
3922,1195
3923,"01:04:01,735 --> 01:04:03,111"
3924,who sent me to Dr. Sapirstein.
3925,1196
3926,"01:04:03,153 --> 01:04:05,405"
3927,"Oh, so Rosemary has told"
3928,you the good news.
3929,1197
3930,"01:04:05,405 --> 01:04:06,781"
3931,"Yes, she has."
3932,1198
3933,"01:04:06,823 --> 01:04:08,575"
3934,We must see that she
3935,gets plenty of rest.
3936,1199
3937,"01:04:08,616 --> 01:04:10,452"
3938,I was a bit alarmed by her appearance.
3939,1200
3940,"01:04:10,493 --> 01:04:12,162"
3941,"Well, she has lost some weight,"
3942,1201
3943,"01:04:12,203 --> 01:04:14,247"
3944,but that's quite normal
3945,for the early months.
3946,1202
3947,"01:04:14,247 --> 01:04:16,916"
3948,"Later on, she'll gain,"
3949,probably far too much.
3950,1203
3951,"01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:19,919"
3952,So I gather.
3953,Please sit down.
3954,1204
3955,"01:04:19,961 --> 01:04:22,589"
3956,Mrs. Castevet makes a vitamin
3957,drink for me every day
3958,1205
3959,"01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:24,257"
3960,from fresh herbs she grows.
3961,1206
3962,"01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:27,093"
3963,"Yes, all according to Dr. Sapirstein's"
3964,"directions, of course."
3965,1207
3966,"01:04:27,093 --> 01:04:29,054"
3967,He's inclined to be suspicious
3968,1208
3969,"01:04:29,095 --> 01:04:31,514"
3970,of commercially prepared vitamin pills.
3971,1209
3972,"01:04:31,556 --> 01:04:33,933"
3973,Indeed? But surely they're manufactured
3974,1210
3975,"01:04:33,933 --> 01:04:35,727"
3976,under every imaginable safeguard.
3977,1211
3978,"01:04:35,769 --> 01:04:38,104"
3979,"That's quite true, but commercial pills"
3980,1212
3981,"01:04:38,146 --> 01:04:40,148"
3982,can sit for months on a druggist's shelf
3983,1213
3984,"01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:42,609"
3985,and lose a great deal of
3986,their original potency.
3987,1214
3988,"01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,110"
3989,I hadn't thought of that.
3990,1215
3991,"01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:47,113"
3992,I like the idea of having everything
3993,fresh and natural.
3994,1216
3995,"01:04:47,155 --> 01:04:50,241"
3996,I'll bet expectant mothers
3997,chewed bits of tannis root
3998,1217
3999,"01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:52,118"
4000,when nobody'd even heard
4001,of vitamin pills.
4002,1218
4003,"01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,661"
4004,Tannis root?
4005,1219
4006,"01:04:53,703 --> 01:04:55,955"
4007,It's one of the herbs
4008,she puts in the drink.
4009,1220
4010,"01:04:55,955 --> 01:04:57,999"
4011,Oris it an herb?
4012,Can a root be an herb?
4013,1221
4014,"01:04:58,041 --> 01:05:00,502"
4015,You sure you don't mean
4016,anise or orris root?
4017,1222
4018,"01:05:00,543 --> 01:05:01,628"
4019,"No, tannis."
4020,1223
4021,"01:05:01,628 --> 01:05:03,004"
4022,Hmm.
4023,1224
4024,"01:05:03,755 --> 01:05:05,298"
4025,Look.
4026,1225
4027,"01:05:06,966 --> 01:05:08,468"
4028,"It's good luck, too."
4029,1226
4030,"01:05:09,636 --> 01:05:10,804"
4031,Ish!
4032,1227
4033,"01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:13,056"
4034,Ha.
4035,1228
4036,"01:05:13,973 --> 01:05:16,309"
4037,"Doesn't look like, uh, root matter,"
4038,1229
4039,"01:05:16,351 --> 01:05:18,978"
4040,more like mold or fungus of some kind.
4041,1230
4042,"01:05:21,022 --> 01:05:22,399"
4043,Is it ever called by any other name?
4044,1231
4045,"01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,942"
4046,"Not to my knowledge, no."
4047,1232
4048,"01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:29,531"
4049,Tannis. I must look it up
4050,in the encyclopedia.
4051,1233
4052,"01:05:29,572 --> 01:05:31,950"
4053,What a pretty holder or
4054,charm or whatever it is.
4055,1234
4056,"01:05:31,991 --> 01:05:33,910"
4057,The Castevets gave it to me.
4058,1235
4059,"01:05:33,952 --> 01:05:35,245"
4060,You and your wife
4061,1236
4062,"01:05:35,286 --> 01:05:36,538"
4063,seem to be taking better
4064,care of Rosemary
4065,1237
4066,"01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:37,872"
4067,than her own parents.
4068,1238
4069,"01:05:37,914 --> 01:05:40,250"
4070,We're very fond of her.
4071,"And of Guy, too."
4072,1239
4073,"01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:42,544"
4074,"Now if you'll excuse me,"
4075,I'll have to go.
4076,1240
4077,"01:05:42,585 --> 01:05:44,045"
4078,My wife is waiting for me.
4079,1241
4080,"01:05:44,087 --> 01:05:45,630"
4081,It's a pleasure to have met you.
4082,1242
4083,"01:05:45,672 --> 01:05:47,549"
4084,"Oh, don't bother, Rosemary."
4085,1243
4086,"01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,175"
4087,"We'll meet again, I'm sure."
4088,1244
4089,"01:05:52,345 --> 01:05:54,848"
4090,I just noticed he has pierced ears.
4091,1245
4092,"01:05:54,889 --> 01:05:57,892"
4093,Pierced ears and piercing eyes.
4094,1246
4095,"01:05:57,934 --> 01:05:59,394"
4096,What's she like?
4097,1247
4098,"01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:02,230"
4099,Nosy. Funny.
4100,1248
4101,"01:06:03,189 --> 01:06:05,191"
4102,Guy's gotten very close to them.
4103,1249
4104,"01:06:05,233 --> 01:06:07,944"
4105,I suppose they've become sort
4106,of parent figures for him.
4107,1250
4108,"01:06:10,655 --> 01:06:12,699"
4109,And you?
4110,1251
4111,"01:06:14,659 --> 01:06:17,537"
4112,Sometimes I think they're
4113,too friendly and helpful.
4114,1252
4115,"01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,707"
4116,"Hey, what a surprise."
4117,1253
4118,"01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:22,000"
4119,"How are you, Hutch?"
4120,Good to see you.
4121,1254
4122,"01:06:22,041 --> 01:06:23,376"
4123,You're the surprise.
4124,What happened?
4125,1255
4126,"01:06:23,418 --> 01:06:25,420"
4127,"They stopped for a rewrite,"
4128,those dumb bastards.
4129,1256
4130,"01:06:26,296 --> 01:06:28,631"
4131,"Ah, stay where you are."
4132,Nobody move.
4133,1257
4134,"01:06:28,673 --> 01:06:30,216"
4135,Would you like some coffee?
4136,1258
4137,"01:06:30,216 --> 01:06:31,426"
4138,Love some.
4139,1259
4140,"01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:39,017"
4141,Loot!
4142,1260
4143,"01:06:39,058 --> 01:06:40,768"
4144,Seems congratulations are in order.
4145,1261
4146,"01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:41,853"
4147,"Yeah, it's wonderful, isn't it?"
4148,1262
4149,"01:06:41,895 --> 01:06:43,104"
4150,When's the baby due?
4151,1263
4152,"01:06:43,146 --> 01:06:44,898"
4153,June 28th.
4154,1264
4155,"01:06:44,898 --> 01:06:46,191"
4156,Did you know that Dr. Sapirstein
4157,1265
4158,"01:06:46,232 --> 01:06:48,401"
4159,delivered two of Hutch's grandchildren?
4160,1266
4161,"01:06:48,401 --> 01:06:49,819"
4162,Really?
4163,Mmm.
4164,1267
4165,"01:06:49,861 --> 01:06:51,821"
4166,I met your neighbor.
4167,1268
4168,"01:06:51,863 --> 01:06:54,199"
4169,Roman Castevet.
4170,"Oh, did you?"
4171,1269
4172,"01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,408"
4173,"Funny old duck, isn't he?"
4174,1270
4175,"01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:57,410"
4176,Did you ever notice he has pierced ears?
4177,1271
4178,"01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:59,996"
4179,You're kidding.
4180,"No, I'm not. I saw."
4181,1272
4182,"01:07:00,038 --> 01:07:01,831"
4183,It's a shame we haven't
4184,"seen more of you lately,"
4185,1273
4186,"01:07:01,873 --> 01:07:03,875"
4187,but with me being so busy
4188,1274
4189,"01:07:03,917 --> 01:07:05,251"
4190,"and Ro being the way she is,"
4191,1275
4192,"01:07:05,293 --> 01:07:06,503"
4193,we really haven't seen anyone.
4194,1276
4195,"01:07:06,544 --> 01:07:07,921"
4196,Perhaps we can have
4197,dinner together soon.
4198,1277
4199,"01:07:07,962 --> 01:07:09,214"
4200,"You're not going, are you?"
4201,1278
4202,"01:07:09,255 --> 01:07:10,590"
4203,"Thanks for the coffee, my dear."
4204,1279
4205,"01:07:10,632 --> 01:07:12,300"
4206,"Thank you for coming, my dear."
4207,1280
4208,"01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:18,932"
4209,This isn't mine.
4210,It must be yours.
4211,1281
4212,"01:07:18,973 --> 01:07:20,600"
4213,Right you are.
4214,1282
4215,"01:07:20,642 --> 01:07:23,144"
4216,"Have you thought about names,"
4217,or is it too soon?
4218,1283
4219,"01:07:23,186 --> 01:07:25,063"
4220,"Andrew or Douglas if it's a boy,"
4221,1284
4222,"01:07:25,104 --> 01:07:26,731"
4223,Melinda or Sarah if it's a girl.
4224,1285
4225,"01:07:26,773 --> 01:07:28,274"
4226,Sarah?
4227,What happened to Susan?
4228,1286
4229,"01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:30,318"
4230,"Say, is there another of these around?"
4231,1287
4232,"01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,653"
4233,Oh.
4234,1288
4235,"01:07:35,782 --> 01:07:37,617"
4236,"I don't see it, Hutch."
4237,1289
4238,"01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:40,119"
4239,"No, it's not here."
4240,1290
4241,"01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:41,829"
4242,I probably left it at the city center.
4243,1291
4244,"01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:43,414"
4245,I'll stop back there.
4246,1292
4247,"01:07:43,456 --> 01:07:45,083"
4248,"Let's really have that dinner, shall we?"
4249,1293
4250,"01:07:45,124 --> 01:07:46,793"
4251,Definitely.
4252,Next week.
4253,1294
4254,"01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:48,628"
4255,Bye.
4256,Bye-bye.
4257,1295
4258,"01:07:48,628 --> 01:07:50,255"
4259,Bye.
4260,Bye.
4261,1296
4262,"01:07:57,804 --> 01:07:59,305"
4263,It was a nice surprise.
4264,1297
4265,"01:08:00,014 --> 01:08:01,140"
4266,Guess what he said.
4267,1298
4268,"01:08:02,475 --> 01:08:03,768"
4269,What?
4270,1299
4271,"01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:05,061"
4272,I look terrible.
4273,1300
4274,"01:08:05,103 --> 01:08:07,313"
4275,Good old Hutch.
4276,1301
4277,"01:08:07,355 --> 01:08:09,023"
4278,He's spreading cheer wherever he goes.
4279,1302
4280,"01:08:09,065 --> 01:08:10,483"
4281,"I'm going to get a paper, honey."
4282,1303
4283,"01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:14,404"
4284,He's a professional crepehanger.
4285,1304
4286,"01:08:14,445 --> 01:08:15,947"
4287,He's not a professional crepehanger.
4288,1305
4289,"01:08:15,989 --> 01:08:18,032"
4290,Then he's one of the
4291,top-ranking amateurs.
4292,1306
4293,"01:08:29,752 --> 01:08:31,170"
4294,Hello.
4295,1307
4296,"01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:33,548"
4297,"Oh, uh, she's not feeling too well."
4298,1308
4299,"01:08:34,966 --> 01:08:36,050"
4300,"Well, I think she's asleep."
4301,1309
4302,"01:08:36,551 --> 01:08:37,552"
4303,All right.
4304,1310
4305,"01:08:39,262 --> 01:08:40,680"
4306,"Oh, she could be, yeah."
4307,1311
4308,"01:08:42,849 --> 01:08:43,975"
4309,"All right, can you hold on a minute?"
4310,1312
4311,"01:08:48,104 --> 01:08:49,188"
4312,It's Hutch.
4313,He wants to speak to you.
4314,1313
4315,"01:08:49,689 --> 01:08:50,690"
4316,Oh.
4317,1314
4318,"01:08:51,858 --> 01:08:53,067"
4319,"I told him you were resting,"
4320,1315
4321,"01:08:53,109 --> 01:08:54,152"
4322,but he said he couldn't wait.
4323,1316
4324,"01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:03,244"
4325,Hutch?
4326,1317
4327,"01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:05,038"
4328,"Tell me, dear, do you go out at all?"
4329,1318
4330,"01:09:05,872 --> 01:09:09,459"
4331,"Well, I-I haven't been going out. Why?"
4332,1319
4333,"01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,377"
4334,Can you meet me tomorrow
4335,morning at 11:00
4336,1320
4337,"01:09:11,377 --> 01:09:13,046"
4338,in front of the Time-Life building?
4339,1321
4340,"01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:15,757"
4341,"Yes, if you want me to."
4342,1322
4343,"01:09:15,798 --> 01:09:17,383"
4344,What is it?
4345,Can't you tell me now?
4346,1323
4347,"01:09:17,425 --> 01:09:18,843"
4348,I'd rather not.
4349,1324
4350,"01:09:18,885 --> 01:09:20,720"
4351,We can have an early lunch if you like.
4352,1325
4353,"01:09:20,762 --> 01:09:22,221"
4354,That would be nice.
4355,1326
4356,"01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:24,140"
4357,Good. 11:00 then?
4358,Okay.
4359,1327
4360,"01:09:24,182 --> 01:09:25,808"
4361,"Oh, did you find your glove?"
4362,1328
4363,"01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:27,226"
4364,"No, they didn't have it."
4365,1329
4366,"01:09:27,268 --> 01:09:28,770"
4367,"Good night, Rosemary."
4368,Sleep well.
4369,1330
4370,"01:09:28,811 --> 01:09:30,313"
4371,"You, too. Good night."
4372,1331
4373,"01:09:30,855 --> 01:09:32,273"
4374,What was that?
4375,1332
4376,"01:09:32,315 --> 01:09:33,441"
4377,He wants to talk to me.
4378,1333
4379,"01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,234"
4380,What about?
4381,1334
4382,"01:09:35,234 --> 01:09:36,569"
4383,I don't know.
4384,He wouldn't say.
4385,1335
4386,"01:09:37,904 --> 01:09:40,406"
4387,I think those boys' adventure
4388,stories are going to his head.
4389,1336
4390,"01:09:43,743 --> 01:09:45,328"
4391,Where are you meeting him?
4392,1337
4393,"01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:48,414"
4394,"Uh, Time and Life building"
4395,tomorrow at 11:00.
4396,1338
4397,"01:09:51,584 --> 01:09:53,544"
4398,This is ridiculous.
4399,1339
4400,"01:09:53,586 --> 01:09:55,296"
4401,You're pregnant.
4402,I've got the yens.
4403,1340
4404,"01:09:55,338 --> 01:09:56,255"
4405,I'm getting an ice-cream cone.
4406,You want one?
4407,1341
4408,"01:09:56,839 --> 01:09:57,882"
4409,"Yeah, I'd love one."
4410,1342
4411,"01:09:57,924 --> 01:09:59,008"
4412,Vanilla?
4413,1343
4414,"01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:00,677"
4415,Okay.
4416,Okay.
4417,1344
4418,"01:10:22,865 --> 01:10:24,242"
4419,Hi.
4420,1345
4421,"01:10:24,283 --> 01:10:25,952"
4422,"Minnie, I'm going out now,"
4423,1346
4424,"01:10:25,952 --> 01:10:27,453"
4425,so I won't have my drink at 11:00.
4426,1347
4427,"01:10:27,453 --> 01:10:29,288"
4428,"That's fine, dear."
4429,Take it later.
4430,1348
4431,"01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:30,748"
4432,"Buzz me when you get back, huh?"
4433,1349
4434,"01:10:58,693 --> 01:11:01,237"
4435,"Pain, begone."
4436,I will have no more of thee.
4437,1350
4438,"01:11:37,523 --> 01:11:39,066"
4439,Yes?
4440,1351
4441,"01:11:39,108 --> 01:11:40,777"
4442,Is this Edward Hutchins' apartment?
4443,1352
4444,"01:11:40,818 --> 01:11:42,111"
4445,"Yes. Who is this, please?"
4446,1353
4447,"01:11:42,153 --> 01:11:43,654"
4448,My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.
4449,1354
4450,"01:11:43,696 --> 01:11:45,198"
4451,I had an appointment with Mr. Hutchins.
4452,1355
4453,"01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:46,491"
4454,Is he there?
4455,1356
4456,"01:11:47,825 --> 01:11:49,118"
4457,Hello?
4458,1357
4459,"01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,495"
4460,He was taken ill this morning.
4461,1358
4462,"01:11:51,913 --> 01:11:54,707"
4463,Taken ill?
4464,Yes.
4465,1359
4466,"01:11:54,749 --> 01:11:56,876"
4467,He's in a deep coma at
4468,St. Vincent's hospital.
4469,1360
4470,"01:11:57,877 --> 01:11:59,295"
4471,That's awful.
4472,1361
4473,"01:11:59,337 --> 01:12:03,216"
4474,I just spoke to him
4475,last night about 10:30.
4476,1362
4477,"01:12:03,257 --> 01:12:04,884"
4478,I spoke to him at 11:00.
4479,1363
4480,"01:12:04,884 --> 01:12:06,511"
4481,Who is this?
4482,1364
4483,"01:12:06,552 --> 01:12:08,137"
4484,"You don't know me, Rosemary."
4485,1365
4486,"01:12:08,179 --> 01:12:10,389"
4487,"I'm Grace Cardiff, Hutch's friend."
4488,1366
4489,"01:12:10,389 --> 01:12:13,059"
4490,"Um, do they know what's causing it?"
4491,1367
4492,"01:12:13,059 --> 01:12:14,811"
4493,"No, they don't know yet."
4494,1368
4495,"01:12:14,852 --> 01:12:16,771"
4496,"At the moment, he's"
4497,totally unresponsive.
4498,1369
4499,"01:12:18,147 --> 01:12:20,149"
4500,"Oh, I'm going to the hospital now."
4501,1370
4502,"01:12:20,191 --> 01:12:21,567"
4503,Is there anything I can do?
4504,1371
4505,"01:12:21,567 --> 01:12:22,777"
4506,Not really.
4507,1372
4508,"01:12:24,278 --> 01:12:25,863"
4509,"All right, um, thank you."
4510,1373
4511,"01:12:54,183 --> 01:12:56,018"
4512,No!
4513,1374
4514,"01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:59,063"
4515,This is what I call the
4516,long arm of coincidence!
4517,1375
4518,"01:12:59,105 --> 01:13:01,524"
4519,"Ho, ho, ho!"
4520,1376
4521,"01:13:01,566 --> 01:13:04,610"
4522,"I said to myself, as long"
4523,"as Rosemary's going out,"
4524,1377
4525,"01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:07,280"
4526,I might as well go out and do a
4527,little bit of Christmas shopping.
4528,1378
4529,"01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,156"
4530,Now here you are.
4531,Here I am.
4532,1379
4533,"01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:11,367"
4534,Isn't that something?
4535,1380
4536,"01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:13,828"
4537,"Aw, darling, what's the matter?"
4538,You feel all right?
4539,1381
4540,"01:13:15,288 --> 01:13:19,125"
4541,"Aw... aw, you poor thing."
4542,1382
4543,"01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:20,459"
4544,You know what I think?
4545,1383
4546,"01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:22,128"
4547,I think we better be going home now.
4548,1384
4549,"01:13:22,169 --> 01:13:23,546"
4550,What do you say?
4551,1385
4552,"01:13:23,588 --> 01:13:25,590"
4553,"No, no, you have your shopping to do."
4554,1386
4555,"01:13:25,631 --> 01:13:27,341"
4556,"Ah, shoot, there's two more weeks."
4557,1387
4558,"01:13:44,525 --> 01:13:46,277"
4559,It'll stop any day now.
4560,1388
4561,"01:13:47,153 --> 01:13:48,654"
4562,It's like a wire inside me
4563,1389
4564,"01:13:48,654 --> 01:13:50,531"
4565,getting tighter and tighter.
4566,1390
4567,"01:13:50,573 --> 01:13:53,534"
4568,Usually older women with
4569,less flexible joints
4570,1391
4571,"01:13:53,576 --> 01:13:54,660"
4572,have this sort of trouble.
4573,1392
4574,"01:13:55,369 --> 01:13:56,829"
4575,I'm not going out anymore.
4576,1393
4577,"01:13:56,829 --> 01:13:57,997"
4578,You don't have to.
4579,1394
4580,"01:13:58,039 --> 01:13:59,999"
4581,One minute to go!
4582,1395
4583,"01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:04,170"
4584,"Rosemary, I want you to meet Dr. Shand."
4585,1396
4586,"01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:06,172"
4587,He used to be a famous dentist.
4588,1397
4589,"01:14:06,172 --> 01:14:08,174"
4590,He made the chain for your charm.
4591,1398
4592,"01:14:08,174 --> 01:14:09,800"
4593,"Oh, how do you do?"
4594,1399
4595,"01:14:09,842 --> 01:14:11,093"
4596,"Come on, sweetie."
4597,1400
4598,"01:14:11,135 --> 01:14:12,511"
4599,Put this wonderful hat on.
4600,1401
4601,"01:14:13,054 --> 01:14:15,014"
4602,"Doctor, come over here."
4603,1402
4604,"01:14:15,056 --> 01:14:16,307"
4605,"Minnie, Minnie."
4606,1403
4607,"01:14:16,349 --> 01:14:17,892"
4608,Happy new year.
4609,1404
4610,"01:14:17,934 --> 01:14:19,352"
4611,Have a good year.
4612,1405
4613,"01:14:19,352 --> 01:14:21,354"
4614,Happy new year.
4615,1406
4616,"01:14:23,606 --> 01:14:25,983"
4617,To 1966!
4618,1407
4619,"01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:27,777"
4620,The year 1!
4621,1408
4622,"01:15:21,038 --> 01:15:22,081"
4623,What the hell are you doing?
4624,1409
4625,"01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,083"
4626,Planning the menu.
4627,1410
4628,"01:15:25,668 --> 01:15:27,461"
4629,We're having a party
4630,a week from Saturday.
4631,1411
4632,"01:15:29,005 --> 01:15:30,297"
4633,It's for our old--
4634,1412
4635,"01:15:30,339 --> 01:15:31,757"
4636,"I mean, our young friends."
4637,1413
4638,"01:15:31,799 --> 01:15:33,884"
4639,Minnie and Roman are not invited.
4640,1414
4641,"01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,429"
4642,Neither is Laura-Louise.
4643,1415
4644,"01:15:36,429 --> 01:15:38,222"
4645,Nor is Dr. Sapirstein.
4646,1416
4647,"01:15:38,264 --> 01:15:39,640"
4648,It's going to be a very special party.
4649,1417
4650,"01:15:39,682 --> 01:15:41,017"
4651,You have to be under 60 to get in.
4652,1418
4653,"01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:50,234"
4654,Well.
4655,1419
4656,"01:15:50,276 --> 01:15:52,445"
4657,"For a minute there, I didn't"
4658,think I was going to make it.
4659,1420
4660,"01:15:52,486 --> 01:15:53,571"
4661,"You'll make it, all right."
4662,1421
4663,"01:15:53,612 --> 01:15:55,823"
4664,You can be bartender.
4665,1422
4666,"01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:57,033"
4667,"Oh, swell."
4668,1423
4669,"01:15:58,617 --> 01:16:00,578"
4670,Do you really think it's
4671,such a good idea?
4672,1424
4673,"01:16:00,619 --> 01:16:03,205"
4674,I think it's the best idea
4675,I've had in months.
4676,1425
4677,"01:16:03,247 --> 01:16:04,373"
4678,Don't you think you ought to check
4679,1426
4680,"01:16:04,415 --> 01:16:05,875"
4681,with Dr. Sapirstein first?
4682,1427
4683,"01:16:05,916 --> 01:16:08,044"
4684,What for? I'm just giving a party.
4685,1428
4686,"01:16:08,085 --> 01:16:09,962"
4687,I'm not going to swim
4688,the English Channel.
4689,1429
4690,"01:16:09,962 --> 01:16:11,005"
4691,What about the pain?
4692,1430
4693,"01:16:13,132 --> 01:16:14,383"
4694,"Oh, haven't you heard?"
4695,1431
4696,"01:16:14,425 --> 01:16:16,969"
4697,It'll go away in a day or two.
4698,1432
4699,"01:16:17,011 --> 01:16:18,763"
4700,That looks interesting.
4701,1433
4702,"01:16:18,763 --> 01:16:19,638"
4703,What's it for?
4704,1434
4705,"01:16:19,638 --> 01:16:21,724"
4706,We're having some people
4707,over on Saturday.
4708,1435
4709,"01:16:21,766 --> 01:16:23,809"
4710,"Oh, you feel up to entertaining?"
4711,1436
4712,"01:16:23,809 --> 01:16:25,770"
4713,"Yes, I do."
4714,These are old friends
4715,1437
4716,"01:16:25,811 --> 01:16:27,480"
4717,I haven't seen in a long time.
4718,1438
4719,"01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:29,482"
4720,They don't even know yet
4721,that I'm pregnant.
4722,1439
4723,"01:16:29,523 --> 01:16:30,733"
4724,I'll give you a hand if you like.
4725,1440
4726,"01:16:30,775 --> 01:16:32,318"
4727,I'll help you dish things out.
4728,1441
4729,"01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:34,487"
4730,"No, thank you, Minnie, but I can manage."
4731,1442
4732,"01:16:34,487 --> 01:16:35,905"
4733,"It's going to be a buffet,"
4734,1443
4735,"01:16:35,946 --> 01:16:37,573"
4736,"and we're getting a bartender, so--"
4737,1444
4738,"01:16:37,615 --> 01:16:39,658"
4739,I'll help you take the coats.
4740,1445
4741,"01:16:39,658 --> 01:16:42,661"
4742,"No, really, you do too"
4743,much for me as it is.
4744,1446
4745,"01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,499"
4746,"Well, let me know if"
4747,you change your mind.
4748,1447
4749,"01:16:46,499 --> 01:16:47,666"
4750,Drink your drink now.
4751,1448
4752,"01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:51,170"
4753,I'd rather not.
4754,1449
4755,"01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:52,797"
4756,Not right this minute.
4757,1450
4758,"01:16:52,838 --> 01:16:54,090"
4759,I'll drink it in a little while.
4760,1451
4761,"01:16:55,216 --> 01:16:56,675"
4762,It don't do to let it stand.
4763,1452
4764,"01:16:56,675 --> 01:16:58,344"
4765,"No, I won't wait too long."
4766,1453
4767,"01:16:58,344 --> 01:16:59,595"
4768,"You go on back,"
4769,1454
4770,"01:16:59,637 --> 01:17:01,180"
4771,and I'll bring the glass
4772,back to you later.
4773,1455
4774,"01:17:01,222 --> 01:17:03,015"
4775,I'll wait.
4776,I'll save you the walk.
4777,1456
4778,"01:17:03,015 --> 01:17:05,351"
4779,You'll do no such thing.
4780,It makes me very nervous
4781,1457
4782,"01:17:05,351 --> 01:17:06,352"
4783,when people watch me cook.
4784,1458
4785,"01:17:06,352 --> 01:17:07,645"
4786,"Now, scoot."
4787,1459
4788,"01:17:07,686 --> 01:17:09,522"
4789,Don't let it stand too long.
4790,1460
4791,"01:17:09,563 --> 01:17:10,940"
4792,It's going to lose its vitamins.
4793,1461
4794,"01:17:22,243 --> 01:17:25,830"
4795,"You dirty, stinking secret-keeper."
4796,Congratulations!
4797,1462
4798,"01:17:25,871 --> 01:17:28,040"
4799,Congratulations.
4800,Thank you.
4801,1463
4802,"01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:29,041"
4803,"Hey, Rosie."
4804,1464
4805,"01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:31,001"
4806,Yeah?
4807,1465
4808,"01:17:31,043 --> 01:17:33,254"
4809,Bob and Leo got stuck
4810,"at another party, dear,"
4811,1466
4812,"01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:34,421"
4813,but they'll be over right away.
4814,1467
4815,"01:17:34,463 --> 01:17:35,631"
4816,"Oh, fine."
4817,1468
4818,"01:17:37,383 --> 01:17:39,635"
4819,You're so lucky.
4820,It's a fantastic house.
4821,1469
4822,"01:17:40,052 --> 01:17:41,137"
4823,Hi.
4824,1470
4825,"01:17:43,013 --> 01:17:44,682"
4826,It's been so long.
4827,1471
4828,"01:17:44,723 --> 01:17:45,975"
4829,You look like a piece of chalk.
4830,1472
4831,"01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:49,770"
4832,"You make him feed you, love."
4833,1473
4834,"01:17:53,732 --> 01:17:54,775"
4835,Adrian Marcato lived here.
4836,1474
4837,"01:17:54,817 --> 01:17:56,110"
4838,And the Trench sisters.
4839,1475
4840,"01:17:56,152 --> 01:17:57,403"
4841,Trent sisters?
4842,1476
4843,"01:17:57,403 --> 01:17:58,654"
4844,Trench. They ate little children.
4845,1477
4846,"01:17:58,696 --> 01:18:00,656"
4847,He doesn't just mean
4848,they ate them.
4849,1478
4850,"01:18:00,698 --> 01:18:01,866"
4851,He means they ate
4852,them.
4853,1479
4854,"01:18:08,914 --> 01:18:10,749"
4855,I made their first one strong
4856,"to get them happy,"
4857,1480
4858,"01:18:10,749 --> 01:18:12,251"
4859,"then I go light and conserve, eh?"
4860,1481
4861,"01:18:12,293 --> 01:18:13,586"
4862,"Rosie, do you feel okay?"
4863,1482
4864,"01:18:13,627 --> 01:18:14,920"
4865,You look a little tired.
4866,1483
4867,"01:18:17,006 --> 01:18:18,883"
4868,Thanks for the understatement.
4869,1484
4870,"01:18:21,427 --> 01:18:22,595"
4871,How do you like C.C. Hill?
4872,1485
4873,"01:18:22,595 --> 01:18:24,096"
4874,Isn't he a dream boy?
4875,1486
4876,"01:18:24,096 --> 01:18:25,514"
4877,"Mm-hmm, but I-I--"
4878,1487
4879,"01:18:25,598 --> 01:18:27,016"
4880,I'm not going to him.
4881,1488
4882,"01:18:28,058 --> 01:18:29,435"
4883,You're not?
4884,1489
4885,"01:18:29,476 --> 01:18:32,146"
4886,I've got another doctor named
4887,"Sapirstein, an older man."
4888,1490
4889,"01:18:32,897 --> 01:18:34,607"
4890,"Oh, congratulations, Papa."
4891,1491
4892,"01:18:34,648 --> 01:18:36,025"
4893,Thanks. Weren't nothing to it.
4894,1492
4895,"01:18:36,066 --> 01:18:37,651"
4896,"Ro, I'm going to take that dip inside."
4897,1493
4898,"01:18:37,693 --> 01:18:40,196"
4899,"Oh, yeah, please."
4900,See my flowers?
4901,1494
4902,"01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:41,697"
4903,Yeah.
4904,1495
4905,"01:18:41,739 --> 01:18:43,449"
4906,"Elise, will you give me a hand?"
4907,1496
4908,"01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,909"
4909,"Oh, yeah, sure."
4910,1497
4911,"01:18:50,581 --> 01:18:53,209"
4912,"Hey, whatever happened to the other guy?"
4913,Is he still blind?
4914,1498
4915,"01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,836"
4916,Donald Baumgart?
4917,"Well, you know who he is."
4918,1499
4919,"01:18:55,878 --> 01:18:57,338"
4920,He's the boy that Zoe Piper
4921,lives with.
4922,1500
4923,"01:18:57,379 --> 01:18:59,131"
4924,He's writing a play.
4925,1501
4926,"01:18:59,131 --> 01:19:00,424"
4927,Is he still blind?
4928,1502
4929,"01:19:00,466 --> 01:19:02,760"
4930,Yeah. He's going through hell
4931,1503
4932,"01:19:02,801 --> 01:19:03,969"
4933,trying to make the adjustment.
4934,1504
4935,"01:19:04,678 --> 01:19:06,305"
4936,"He dictates, and Zoe writes."
4937,1505
4938,"01:19:14,438 --> 01:19:15,689"
4939,Are you all right?
4940,1506
4941,"01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:19,485"
4942,"Yeah, I'm fine."
4943,1507
4944,"01:19:19,526 --> 01:19:20,945"
4945,I just had a cramp for a minute.
4946,1508
4947,"01:19:22,154 --> 01:19:23,739"
4948,Don't cry.
4949,It's all right.
4950,1509
4951,"01:19:23,739 --> 01:19:24,490"
4952,It's good for her.
4953,1510
4954,"01:19:24,531 --> 01:19:25,991"
4955,Let her cry it out.
4956,1511
4957,"01:19:26,033 --> 01:19:27,117"
4958,"It's all right, darling."
4959,It's all right.
4960,1512
4961,"01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:28,827"
4962,"Sit down, sit down."
4963,1513
4964,"01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:35,417"
4965,"Hey, let me in."
4966,1514
4967,"01:19:35,459 --> 01:19:36,627"
4968,"Sorry, girls only."
4969,1515
4970,"01:19:36,669 --> 01:19:37,670"
4971,I want to talk to Rosemary.
4972,1516
4973,"01:19:37,711 --> 01:19:39,004"
4974,You can't.
4975,She's busy.
4976,1517
4977,"01:19:39,004 --> 01:19:40,965"
4978,I have to wash these--
4979,Use the bathroom.
4980,1518
4981,"01:19:46,178 --> 01:19:47,805"
4982,It hurts so much.
4983,1519
4984,"01:19:47,846 --> 01:19:49,682"
4985,I'm so afraid the baby's gonna die.
4986,1520
4987,"01:19:50,266 --> 01:19:51,350"
4988,When did the pain start?
4989,1521
4990,"01:19:52,559 --> 01:19:54,019"
4991,um...
4992,1522
4993,"01:19:54,061 --> 01:19:55,854"
4994,"in, uh, November."
4995,1523
4996,"01:19:56,355 --> 01:19:58,023"
4997,November?
4998,What?
4999,1524
5000,"01:19:59,024 --> 01:20:01,151"
5001,You have been in pain
5002,"since November,"
5003,1525
5004,"01:20:01,193 --> 01:20:02,903"
5005,and he's not doing anything
5006,to help you?
5007,1526
5008,"01:20:02,945 --> 01:20:04,863"
5009,He says it's gonna stop.
5010,1527
5011,"01:20:05,823 --> 01:20:07,366"
5012,Why don't you go to see another doctor?
5013,1528
5014,"01:20:07,366 --> 01:20:08,993"
5015,"No, he's very good."
5016,1529
5017,"01:20:09,576 --> 01:20:11,704"
5018,He was on Open End.
5019,1530
5020,"01:20:11,745 --> 01:20:13,914"
5021,He sounds like a sadistic nut.
5022,1531
5023,"01:20:13,956 --> 01:20:16,250"
5024,"Rosemary, pain like that"
5025,1532
5026,"01:20:16,292 --> 01:20:18,669"
5027,is a warning that something isn't right.
5028,1533
5029,"01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:21,547"
5030,Go see Dr. Hill.
5031,1534
5032,"01:20:21,588 --> 01:20:23,632"
5033,Go see anybody besides that-- that--
5034,1535
5035,"01:20:23,674 --> 01:20:25,509"
5036,That nut.
5037,1536
5038,"01:20:25,551 --> 01:20:27,386"
5039,You can't go on suffering like this.
5040,1537
5041,"01:20:27,386 --> 01:20:29,138"
5042,I won't have an abortion.
5043,1538
5044,"01:20:29,179 --> 01:20:31,598"
5045,Nobody's telling you
5046,to have an abortion.
5047,1539
5048,"01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:33,267"
5049,Just go to see another
5050,"doctor, that's all."
5051,1540
5052,"01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:44,445"
5053,The thing to do now is move.
5054,1541
5055,"01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:46,613"
5056,Guy?
5057,1542
5058,"01:20:46,655 --> 01:20:47,990"
5059,Yeah?
5060,1543
5061,"01:20:48,032 --> 01:20:50,159"
5062,I'm going to Dr. Hill Monday morning.
5063,1544
5064,"01:20:52,202 --> 01:20:55,539"
5065,Dr. Sapirstein is either
5066,"lying, or he's--"
5067,1545
5068,"01:20:55,581 --> 01:20:57,791"
5069,"I don't know, out of his mind."
5070,1546
5071,"01:20:57,833 --> 01:21:00,085"
5072,Pain like this is a warning
5073,something's wrong.
5074,1547
5075,"01:21:00,085 --> 01:21:01,337"
5076,Rosemary--
5077,1548
5078,"01:21:01,378 --> 01:21:04,214"
5079,And I'm not drinking Minnie's
5080,drink anymore.
5081,1549
5082,"01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,759"
5083,I want vitamins and pills
5084,like everyone else.
5085,1550
5086,"01:21:08,427 --> 01:21:10,429"
5087,I haven't drunk it for
5088,the last three days.
5089,1551
5090,"01:21:10,429 --> 01:21:11,430"
5091,I've thrown it away.
5092,1552
5093,"01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:12,681"
5094,You've what?
5095,1553
5096,"01:21:12,723 --> 01:21:14,433"
5097,I've made my own drink.
5098,1554
5099,"01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:18,312"
5100,Is that what those bitches
5101,were giving you in there?
5102,1555
5103,"01:21:19,646 --> 01:21:21,607"
5104,And is that their hint for today?
5105,1556
5106,"01:21:21,648 --> 01:21:22,941"
5107,They're my friends--
5108,1557
5109,"01:21:22,983 --> 01:21:25,611"
5110,They're a bunch of not
5111,very bright bitches
5112,1558
5113,"01:21:25,611 --> 01:21:27,738"
5114,who ought to mind their
5115,own goddamn business!
5116,1559
5117,"01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:30,074"
5118,All they said was get a second opinion.
5119,1560
5120,"01:21:30,115 --> 01:21:31,784"
5121,"Rosemary, you got the best"
5122,doctor in New York.
5123,1561
5124,"01:21:31,825 --> 01:21:32,951"
5125,You know who Dr. Hill is?
5126,1562
5127,"01:21:32,951 --> 01:21:34,495"
5128,He's a charlie nobody.
5129,1563
5130,"01:21:34,536 --> 01:21:35,871"
5131,That's who he is!
5132,1564
5133,"01:21:35,913 --> 01:21:39,249"
5134,I'm tired of hearing how
5135,great Dr. Sapirstein is.
5136,1565
5137,"01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:42,044"
5138,"Well, we'll have to pay Sapirstein."
5139,1566
5140,"01:21:42,086 --> 01:21:44,463"
5141,We'll have to pay Hill.
5142,It's out of the question.
5143,1567
5144,"01:21:44,463 --> 01:21:46,382"
5145,"No, I'm not changing."
5146,1568
5147,"01:21:46,423 --> 01:21:48,967"
5148,I just wanna go to Dr. Hill
5149,and get a second opinion.
5150,1569
5151,"01:21:49,009 --> 01:21:50,761"
5152,"I won't let you do it, Ro."
5153,1570
5154,"01:21:50,803 --> 01:21:52,971"
5155,"I mean, because it's, uh--"
5156,1571
5157,"01:21:52,971 --> 01:21:54,473"
5158,It's not fair to Sapirstein.
5159,1572
5160,"01:21:55,349 --> 01:21:57,351"
5161,Not fair to--
5162,1573
5163,"01:21:58,143 --> 01:22:00,145"
5164,What are you talking about?
5165,1574
5166,"01:22:00,145 --> 01:22:01,939"
5167,What about what's fair to me?
5168,1575
5169,"01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:04,233"
5170,You want a second opinion?
5171,1576
5172,"01:22:04,274 --> 01:22:07,820"
5173,You tell Sapirstein and let
5174,him decide who gives it.
5175,1577
5176,"01:22:07,861 --> 01:22:10,531"
5177,No! I want Dr. Hill!
5178,1578
5179,"01:22:10,572 --> 01:22:12,074"
5180,At least have that much courtesy--
5181,"If you won't pay,"
5182,1579
5183,"01:22:12,116 --> 01:22:13,283"
5184,then I'll--
5185,1580
5186,"01:22:17,663 --> 01:22:18,997"
5187,Ro?
5188,1581
5189,"01:22:19,998 --> 01:22:22,126"
5190,Rosemary?
5191,What is it?
5192,1582
5193,"01:22:23,794 --> 01:22:25,003"
5194,It stopped.
5195,1583
5196,"01:22:26,463 --> 01:22:28,507"
5197,What?
5198,1584
5199,"01:22:28,549 --> 01:22:30,676"
5200,The pain stopped just like that.
5201,1585
5202,"01:22:30,676 --> 01:22:32,386"
5203,Stopped?
5204,Stopped.
5205,1586
5206,"01:22:34,847 --> 01:22:36,390"
5207,What was in that drink you made?
5208,1587
5209,"01:22:39,143 --> 01:22:40,269"
5210,uh...
5211,1588
5212,"01:22:40,894 --> 01:22:43,147"
5213,"eggs, milk, sug--"
5214,1589
5215,"01:22:43,605 --> 01:22:45,232"
5216,Sugar.
5217,1590
5218,"01:22:45,274 --> 01:22:46,525"
5219,What else?
5220,1591
5221,"01:22:49,236 --> 01:22:50,863"
5222,Ha!
5223,What else?
5224,1592
5225,"01:22:52,364 --> 01:22:54,867"
5226,"Come on, Rosemary, for Christ's sakes,"
5227,what else was in that drink?
5228,1593
5229,"01:22:57,161 --> 01:22:58,704"
5230,It's alive!
5231,1594
5232,"01:22:58,745 --> 01:23:00,914"
5233,"Guy, it's moving!"
5234,1595
5235,"01:23:00,956 --> 01:23:02,541"
5236,It's alive!
5237,It's all right!
5238,1596
5239,"01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:05,461"
5240,Feel. Feel.
5241,1597
5242,"01:23:05,502 --> 01:23:07,045"
5243,"Oh, yeah, I felt it."
5244,1598
5245,"01:23:07,045 --> 01:23:08,922"
5246,Don't be scared.
5247,It won't bite you.
5248,1599
5249,"01:23:08,964 --> 01:23:10,466"
5250,It's wonderful.
5251,It really is.
5252,1600
5253,"01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:13,051"
5254,I feel it kicking.
5255,1601
5256,"01:23:13,677 --> 01:23:16,346"
5257,It's alive!
5258,It's moving!
5259,1602
5260,"01:23:21,226 --> 01:23:23,520"
5261,"I'll, uh, clean up some of this mess."
5262,1603
5263,"01:23:40,913 --> 01:23:42,414"
5264,Watch the walls.
5265,1604
5266,"01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,634"
5267,"Thanks, boys."
5268,Have one on the baby.
5269,1605
5270,"01:23:53,675 --> 01:23:54,927"
5271,Thank you very much.
5272,1606
5273,"01:24:24,414 --> 01:24:25,874"
5274,What's that for?
5275,1607
5276,"01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:27,918"
5277,This is my hospital suitcase.
5278,1608
5279,"01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:30,337"
5280,"Honey, you got three weeks."
5281,1609
5282,"01:24:36,635 --> 01:24:38,053"
5283,Yes?
5284,1610
5285,"01:24:38,095 --> 01:24:39,638"
5286,"Hello, Mrs. Cardiff."
5287,1611
5288,"01:24:41,765 --> 01:24:42,975"
5289,No.
5290,1612
5291,"01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,394"
5292,"Oh, my God."
5293,1613
5294,"01:24:47,813 --> 01:24:49,147"
5295,"Oh, my God."
5296,1614
5297,"01:24:50,065 --> 01:24:51,608"
5298,"Yes, of course I will."
5299,1615
5300,"01:25:03,954 --> 01:25:05,330"
5301,Hutch is dead.
5302,1616
5303,"01:25:11,003 --> 01:25:12,504"
5304,I feel awful.
5305,1617
5306,"01:25:12,546 --> 01:25:14,172"
5307,"All this time, I didn't"
5308,even think of him.
5309,1618
5310,"01:25:37,154 --> 01:25:38,905"
5311,"Doris, we'll see you later."
5312,1619
5313,"01:25:38,947 --> 01:25:40,741"
5314,I beg your pardon.
5315,1620
5316,"01:25:40,782 --> 01:25:43,035"
5317,I'm Mrs. Woodhouse.
5318,I knew your father.
5319,1621
5320,"01:25:43,035 --> 01:25:44,536"
5321,"Oh, so you're Rosemary."
5322,1622
5323,"01:25:44,578 --> 01:25:45,871"
5324,I'm terribly sorry.
5325,1623
5326,"01:25:45,871 --> 01:25:47,748"
5327,Thank you.
5328,This is my sister Edna.
5329,1624
5330,"01:25:47,789 --> 01:25:49,750"
5331,How do you do?
5332,And my husband.
5333,1625
5334,"01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:51,877"
5335,How do you do?
5336,I'm sorry to be late.
5337,1626
5338,"01:25:51,877 --> 01:25:54,004"
5339,Excuse me.
5340,Yes?
5341,1627
5342,"01:25:54,046 --> 01:25:56,715"
5343,I'm Grace Cardiff.
5344,I was hoping to meet you.
5345,1628
5346,"01:25:56,757 --> 01:25:58,050"
5347,Thank you for calling me.
5348,1629
5349,"01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:00,510"
5350,"I was going to mail this, but then"
5351,I thought you would be here.
5352,1630
5353,"01:26:00,552 --> 01:26:03,096"
5354,What is it?
5355,A book.
5356,1631
5357,"01:26:03,138 --> 01:26:05,098"
5358,Hutch regained consciousness
5359,"at the end,"
5360,1632
5361,"01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,392"
5362,and he thought it was the next morning.
5363,1633
5364,"01:26:07,392 --> 01:26:08,727"
5365,"You know, when you had the appointment."
5366,1634
5367,"01:26:08,727 --> 01:26:10,896"
5368,"Oh, yes."
5369,1635
5370,"01:26:10,937 --> 01:26:12,397"
5371,"I wasn't there, but he told the doctor"
5372,1636
5373,"01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:14,900"
5374,to make sure you got the
5375,book that was on his desk.
5376,1637
5377,"01:26:14,941 --> 01:26:16,234"
5378,Thank you.
5379,1638
5380,"01:26:17,903 --> 01:26:20,030"
5381,"Oh, and I'm to tell you"
5382,the name is an anagram.
5383,1639
5384,"01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:21,073"
5385,The name of the book?
5386,1640
5387,"01:26:21,615 --> 01:26:23,367"
5388,Apparently.
5389,1641
5390,"01:26:23,408 --> 01:26:25,369"
5391,"He was delirious, so"
5392,it's hard to be sure.
5393,1642
5394,"01:26:51,603 --> 01:26:52,896"
5395,I heard you come in.
5396,1643
5397,"01:26:52,938 --> 01:26:54,272"
5398,It certainly wasn't very long.
5399,1644
5400,"01:26:54,272 --> 01:26:55,941"
5401,I was late.
5402,I couldn't get a taxi.
5403,1645
5404,"01:26:55,941 --> 01:26:57,651"
5405,"Oh, what a shame."
5406,1646
5407,"01:26:57,693 --> 01:26:58,777"
5408,"Oh, you got mail already?"
5409,1647
5410,"01:26:59,778 --> 01:27:01,613"
5411,Somebody gave it to me.
5412,1648
5413,"01:27:01,655 --> 01:27:03,281"
5414,Here. I'll hold it.
5415,1649
5416,"01:27:03,865 --> 01:27:05,158"
5417,Book.
5418,1650
5419,"01:27:06,952 --> 01:27:08,328"
5420,"Oh, I know that house."
5421,1651
5422,"01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:09,621"
5423,The Gilmores used to live there.
5424,1652
5425,"01:27:09,621 --> 01:27:11,289"
5426,Oh?
5427,Yeah.
5428,1653
5429,"01:27:11,331 --> 01:27:13,417"
5430,I've been there lots of times.
5431,1654
5432,"01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:15,711"
5433,Grace-- That's one of my favorite names.
5434,1655
5435,"01:27:15,752 --> 01:27:16,962"
5436,Yes.
5437,1656
5438,"01:27:16,962 --> 01:27:18,463"
5439,You need anything?
5440,1657
5441,"01:27:18,505 --> 01:27:20,924"
5442,"Nothing, thank you."
5443,"Take a nap, why don't you?"
5444,1658
5445,"01:27:20,966 --> 01:27:22,300"
5446,I'm going to.
5447,Yeah. Good-bye.
5448,1659
5449,"01:28:04,259 --> 01:28:07,012"
5450,"Born in Glasgow in 1846,

1660
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:49,306
he was soon after brought to New York."
5451,1661
5452,"01:28:09,347 --> 01:28:11,349"
5453,"He resided for several
years in the United St--

1662
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:55,353
He was attacked by a mob"
5454,outside the Bram--
5455,1663
5456,"01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:19,191"
5457,"Outside, not in the lobby."""
5458,1664
5459,"01:28:29,367 --> 01:28:31,703"
5460,There are no witches.
5461,Not really.
5462,1665
5463,"01:28:35,373 --> 01:28:36,792"
5464,The name is an anagram.
5465,1666
5466,"01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:01,459"
5467,"Now, that really makes sense."
5468,1667
5469,"01:30:04,254 --> 01:30:05,881"
5470,Poor Hutch.
5471,1668
5472,"01:31:01,937 --> 01:31:03,355"
5473,Ro?
5474,1669
5475,"01:31:07,984 --> 01:31:09,027"
5476,What's with the chain?
5477,1670
5478,"01:31:12,822 --> 01:31:13,823"
5479,What's the matter?
5480,1671
5481,"01:31:16,034 --> 01:31:17,369"
5482,You all right?
5483,I'm fine.
5484,1672
5485,"01:31:18,078 --> 01:31:19,454"
5486,Oh.
5487,1673
5488,"01:31:19,496 --> 01:31:20,789"
5489,"Oh, why, thank you."
5490,1674
5491,"01:31:21,373 --> 01:31:22,666"
5492,How was the funeral?
5493,1675
5494,"01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:24,542"
5495,Okay.
5496,1676
5497,"01:31:24,584 --> 01:31:26,544"
5498,Got the shirt that was
5499,in the New Yorker.
5500,1677
5501,"01:31:31,925 --> 01:31:34,219"
5502,I got that shirt that
5503,was in the New Yorker.
5504,1678
5505,"01:31:34,219 --> 01:31:36,221"
5506,That's nice.
5507,1679
5508,"01:31:36,221 --> 01:31:37,555"
5509,Do you know who Roman really is?
5510,1680
5511,"01:31:37,555 --> 01:31:39,224"
5512,"What do you mean, honey?"
5513,1681
5514,"01:31:39,224 --> 01:31:41,726"
5515,He's Adrian Marcato's son.
5516,What?
5517,1682
5518,"01:31:41,726 --> 01:31:43,395"
5519,Come here.
5520,1683
5521,"01:31:43,436 --> 01:31:44,980"
5522,I want to show you something.
5523,1684
5524,"01:31:46,356 --> 01:31:49,859"
5525,Roman Castevet is Steven
5526,Marcato rearranged.
5527,1685
5528,"01:31:51,945 --> 01:31:53,697"
5529,It's from Hutch.
5530,1686
5531,"01:31:59,285 --> 01:32:00,578"
5532,Look.
5533,1687
5534,"01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:03,665"
5535,And look here.
5536,1688
5537,"01:32:03,707 --> 01:32:06,459"
5538,There he is when he was 13.
5539,See the eyes?
5540,1689
5541,"01:32:09,379 --> 01:32:10,797"
5542,Coincidence.
5543,1690
5544,"01:32:10,839 --> 01:32:13,758"
5545,In the same house?
5546,And look. Look here.
5547,1691
5548,"01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,428"
5549,"Soon after that in August, 1886,

1692
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:58,221
his son Steven was born."
5550,1693
5551,"01:32:18,263 --> 01:32:19,556"
5552,1886. Got it?
5553,1694
5554,"01:32:19,597 --> 01:32:21,099"
5555,That makes him 79 now.
5556,1695
5557,"01:32:21,891 --> 01:32:23,476"
5558,No coincidence.
5559,1696
5560,"01:32:28,148 --> 01:32:30,442"
5561,"No, I guess not."
5562,1697
5563,"01:32:30,483 --> 01:32:32,027"
5564,"He's Steven Marcato, all right."
5565,1698
5566,"01:32:33,528 --> 01:32:35,947"
5567,Poor old geezer.
5568,"With a crazy father like that,"
5569,1699
5570,"01:32:35,989 --> 01:32:38,116"
5571,no wonder he switched his name around.
5572,1700
5573,"01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:40,452"
5574,You don't think he's the same?
5575,1701
5576,"01:32:40,493 --> 01:32:42,454"
5577,"What do you mean, a witch?"
5578,1702
5579,"01:32:42,495 --> 01:32:45,790"
5580,"Ro, are you kidding?"
5581,"Oh, Ro, honey."
5582,1703
5583,"01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:49,085"
5584,His father was a martyr to it.
5585,1704
5586,"01:32:49,127 --> 01:32:50,295"
5587,Do you know how he died?
5588,1705
5589,"01:32:50,336 --> 01:32:52,756"
5590,"Honey, it's 1966."
5591,1706
5592,"01:32:52,797 --> 01:32:55,258"
5593,This was published in 1933.
5594,1707
5595,"01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:56,718"
5596,There were covens in Europe.
5597,1708
5598,"01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,804"
5599,That's what they're called--
5600,"the, um, congregation."
5601,1709
5602,"01:32:59,846 --> 01:33:02,474"
5603,"Covens in Europe, in America,"
5604,"and in Australia,"
5605,1710
5606,"01:33:02,474 --> 01:33:04,976"
5607,and they have one right
5608,"here, that whole bunch."
5609,1711
5610,"01:33:04,976 --> 01:33:07,729"
5611,The parties with the singing and
5612,"the flute and the chanting,"
5613,1712
5614,"01:33:07,771 --> 01:33:09,773"
5615,those are esbats or Sabbaths
5616,or whatever they're called.
5617,1713
5618,"01:33:09,814 --> 01:33:12,317"
5619,"Honey, don't get excited."
5620,"Read what they do, Guy."
5621,1714
5622,"01:33:12,317 --> 01:33:14,194"
5623,They use blood in their rituals.
5624,1715
5625,"01:33:14,235 --> 01:33:17,030"
5626,The blood that has the most
5627,power is baby's blood.
5628,1716
5629,"01:33:17,072 --> 01:33:19,240"
5630,"And they don't just use the blood,"
5631,"they use the flesh, too."
5632,1717
5633,"01:33:19,282 --> 01:33:21,201"
5634,"Rosemary, for God's sakes!"
5635,1718
5636,"01:33:21,242 --> 01:33:23,661"
5637,They're not setting foot in
5638,this apartment ever again.
5639,1719
5640,"01:33:23,703 --> 01:33:25,663"
5641,They're not coming within
5642,50 feet of the baby.
5643,1720
5644,"01:33:25,705 --> 01:33:28,541"
5645,They're old people.
5646,They have a bunch of old friends.
5647,1721
5648,"01:33:28,583 --> 01:33:31,127"
5649,Dr. Shand happens to play the recorder.
5650,1722
5651,"01:33:31,169 --> 01:33:33,630"
5652,I'm not taking any chances
5653,with the baby's safety.
5654,1723
5655,"01:33:33,671 --> 01:33:35,006"
5656,We're gonna sublet and move out.
5657,1724
5658,"01:33:35,006 --> 01:33:36,299"
5659,We are not.
5660,1725
5661,"01:33:36,341 --> 01:33:37,801"
5662,We'll talk about it later.
5663,1726
5664,"01:33:42,263 --> 01:33:44,182"
5665,I don't think you ought
5666,to read any more of that.
5667,1727
5668,"01:33:45,183 --> 01:33:46,184"
5669,Just this last chapter.
5670,1728
5671,"01:33:46,226 --> 01:33:47,685"
5672,"Not today, honey."
5673,1729
5674,"01:33:48,645 --> 01:33:49,771"
5675,Look. Your hands are shaking.
5676,1730
5677,"01:33:49,813 --> 01:33:51,022"
5678,Come on.
5679,Give it to me.
5680,1731
5681,"01:33:51,022 --> 01:33:53,650"
5682,Guy!
5683,"I mean it, now."
5684,1732
5685,"01:33:53,650 --> 01:33:54,943"
5686,Give it to me.
5687,1733
5688,"01:34:03,743 --> 01:34:06,538"
5689,Fantastic.
5690,Absolutely fantastic.
5691,1734
5692,"01:34:06,538 --> 01:34:07,997"
5693,"What'd you say the name was,"
5694,Marchado?
5695,1735
5696,"01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:09,541"
5697,Marcato.
5698,1736
5699,"01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:11,793"
5700,He told me his father
5701,was a coffee importer.
5702,1737
5703,"01:34:11,835 --> 01:34:13,545"
5704,He told Guy he was a producer.
5705,1738
5706,"01:34:13,586 --> 01:34:14,921"
5707,I understand how disturbed
5708,you must be
5709,1739
5710,"01:34:14,963 --> 01:34:16,756"
5711,to have him for a close neighbor.
5712,1740
5713,"01:34:16,798 --> 01:34:19,384"
5714,I don't want anything more
5715,to do with him or Minnie.
5716,1741
5717,"01:34:19,384 --> 01:34:21,386"
5718,I can't take even the slightest chance
5719,1742
5720,"01:34:21,386 --> 01:34:22,554"
5721,where the baby's safety's concerned.
5722,1743
5723,"01:34:22,554 --> 01:34:24,097"
5724,Absolutely.
5725,Any mother'd feel the same way.
5726,1744
5727,"01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:27,350"
5728,Is there any chance at all
5729,1745
5730,"01:34:27,392 --> 01:34:29,602"
5731,that maybe Minnie put something
5732,harmful in those drinks
5733,1746
5734,"01:34:29,644 --> 01:34:31,062"
5735,or in those little cakes?
5736,1747
5737,"01:34:31,104 --> 01:34:34,816"
5738,"No, Rosemary, I'd have seen"
5739,evidence of it long ago.
5740,1748
5741,"01:34:34,858 --> 01:34:36,359"
5742,I won't take anything else
5743,from them.
5744,1749
5745,"01:34:36,401 --> 01:34:37,861"
5746,You won't have to.
5747,1750
5748,"01:34:37,902 --> 01:34:39,404"
5749,I can give you some pills
5750,1751
5751,"01:34:39,404 --> 01:34:41,573"
5752,that'll be adequate
5753,these last few weeks.
5754,1752
5755,"01:34:42,490 --> 01:34:45,326"
5756,"In a way, this may be the answer"
5757,1753
5758,"01:34:45,368 --> 01:34:47,412"
5759,"to Minnie and Roman's problem, too."
5760,1754
5761,"01:34:47,412 --> 01:34:48,663"
5762,What do you mean?
5763,1755
5764,"01:34:48,705 --> 01:34:50,373"
5765,Roman's very ill.
5766,1756
5767,"01:34:50,415 --> 01:34:54,002"
5768,"In fact, confidentially, he has"
5769,no more than a month or two left.
5770,1757
5771,"01:34:54,043 --> 01:34:55,378"
5772,I had no idea.
5773,1758
5774,"01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:58,423"
5775,He wanted to pay a last visit to
5776,a few of his favorite cities.
5777,1759
5778,"01:34:58,423 --> 01:34:59,632"
5779,They didn't want to offend you
5780,1760
5781,"01:34:59,674 --> 01:35:00,884"
5782,by leaving before the baby's birth.
5783,1761
5784,"01:35:01,759 --> 01:35:03,928"
5785,I'm sorry to hear that Roman isn't well.
5786,1762
5787,"01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:05,513"
5788,He'd be extremely embarrassed
5789,1763
5790,"01:35:05,555 --> 01:35:07,724"
5791,if he knew what you found out.
5792,1764
5793,"01:35:07,765 --> 01:35:10,518"
5794,Suppose we do this.
5795,I'll tell him to leave on Sunday.
5796,1765
5797,"01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,729"
5798,"I'll say I spoke to you,"
5799,and you understand.
5800,1766
5801,"01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:14,939"
5802,Are you sure they'll leave on Sunday?
5803,1767
5804,"01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:15,899"
5805,I'll see to it.
5806,1768
5807,"01:35:18,902 --> 01:35:20,695"
5808,"No matter where we are,"
5809,1769
5810,"01:35:20,737 --> 01:35:21,905"
5811,our thoughts are gonna
5812,be with you every minute
5813,1770
5814,"01:35:22,947 --> 01:35:24,782"
5815,"till you're all happy and thin again,"
5816,1771
5817,"01:35:24,782 --> 01:35:25,950"
5818,your sweet little boy or girl
5819,1772
5820,"01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:27,994"
5821,laying safely in your arms.
5822,1773
5823,"01:35:28,036 --> 01:35:29,871"
5824,Thank you.
5825,Thank you for everything.
5826,1774
5827,"01:35:29,913 --> 01:35:32,123"
5828,Yeah. You make Guy send us
5829,"lots of pictures, ya hear?"
5830,1775
5831,"01:35:32,165 --> 01:35:33,666"
5832,"Yes, I will."
5833,1776
5834,"01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:35,418"
5835,"Now, I'm not going to"
5836,"wish you good luck,"
5837,1777
5838,"01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:36,628"
5839,because you won't need it.
5840,1778
5841,"01:35:36,628 --> 01:35:38,880"
5842,You're going to have
5843,"a happy, happy life."
5844,1779
5845,"01:35:38,922 --> 01:35:41,758"
5846,Have a good trip and come back safely.
5847,1780
5848,"01:35:41,799 --> 01:35:45,470"
5849,Perhaps. But I may stay
5850,in Dubrovnik or Pescara
5851,1781
5852,"01:35:45,511 --> 01:35:47,305"
5853,or maybe Majorca.
5854,1782
5855,"01:35:47,347 --> 01:35:49,140"
5856,We shall see.
5857,We shall see.
5858,1783
5859,"01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:50,683"
5860,Come back.
5861,"Bye, Minnie."
5862,1784
5863,"01:35:50,725 --> 01:35:52,143"
5864,"Yeah, good-bye."
5865,1785
5866,"01:35:52,143 --> 01:35:53,811"
5867,"Good-bye, Roman."
5868,Bye-bye.
5869,1786
5870,"01:35:53,811 --> 01:35:54,646"
5871,Take care now.
5872,1787
5873,"01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,023"
5874,"Kennedy airport, Pan Am building."
5875,1788
5876,"01:35:57,774 --> 01:35:59,651"
5877,Bye!
5878,"Bye, Roman."
5879,1789
5880,"01:36:02,445 --> 01:36:03,821"
5881,"Oh, boy."
5882,1790
5883,"01:36:09,577 --> 01:36:11,329"
5884,Guy?
5885,Hmm?
5886,1791
5887,"01:36:11,371 --> 01:36:13,331"
5888,Where's my book?
5889,1792
5890,"01:36:13,373 --> 01:36:15,667"
5891,"Oh, I put it in the garbage."
5892,1793
5893,"01:36:18,169 --> 01:36:19,420"
5894,What?
5895,1794
5896,"01:36:19,462 --> 01:36:21,798"
5897,I didn't want you upsetting
5898,yourself anymore.
5899,1795
5900,"01:36:21,839 --> 01:36:24,384"
5901,"Guy, Hutch gave me that book."
5902,1796
5903,"01:36:24,425 --> 01:36:25,635"
5904,He left it to me.
5905,1797
5906,"01:36:25,677 --> 01:36:27,053"
5907,I wasn't thinking about that.
5908,1798
5909,"01:36:27,095 --> 01:36:28,680"
5910,That's a terrible thing to do.
5911,1799
5912,"01:36:28,721 --> 01:36:30,223"
5913,I'm sorry. I wasn't
5914,thinking about Hutch.
5915,1800
5916,"01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:39,857"
5917,"Hey, watch out, lady!"
5918,1801
5919,"01:37:34,579 --> 01:37:38,541"
5920,"In some cults it was believed that
a personal possession of the victim

1802
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:21,794
was necessary and spells cannot be cast"
5921,1803
5922,"01:37:41,836 --> 01:37:44,047"
5923,"without one of the victim's belongings."""
5924,1804
5925,"01:37:44,839 --> 01:37:47,759"
5926,Yeah?
5927,Is this Donald Baumgart?
5928,1805
5929,"01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:50,928"
5930,That's right.
5931,"This is Rosemary Woodhouse,"
5932,1806
5933,"01:37:50,928 --> 01:37:52,513"
5934,Guy Woodhouse's wife.
5935,1807
5936,"01:37:52,555 --> 01:37:53,848"
5937,"Oh, yes."
5938,1808
5939,"01:37:53,890 --> 01:37:55,683"
5940,I want to know--
5941,1809
5942,"01:37:55,725 --> 01:37:58,019"
5943,"You must be a happy little lady,"
5944,1810
5945,"01:37:58,061 --> 01:38:00,563"
5946,"living in the Bram, rows"
5947,of uniformed lackeys.
5948,1811
5949,"01:38:00,605 --> 01:38:01,773"
5950,"I wanted to know how you are,"
5951,1812
5952,"01:38:01,773 --> 01:38:02,940"
5953,if there's been any improvement.
5954,1813
5955,"01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,609"
5956,"Well, bless your heart."
5957,1814
5958,"01:38:04,609 --> 01:38:08,071"
5959,"Ha, ha, hal"
5960,"Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?"
5961,1815
5962,"01:38:08,112 --> 01:38:11,199"
5963,"Well, I'm splendid."
5964,I only broke six glasses today.
5965,1816
5966,"01:38:13,785 --> 01:38:15,953"
5967,Guy and I are both very unhappy
5968,1817
5969,"01:38:15,995 --> 01:38:19,123"
5970,that he got his break because
5971,of your misfortune.
5972,1818
5973,"01:38:22,251 --> 01:38:24,670"
5974,"Aw, what the hell."
5975,1819
5976,"01:38:24,712 --> 01:38:26,089"
5977,"That's the way it goes, right?"
5978,1820
5979,"01:38:27,632 --> 01:38:30,468"
5980,I'm sorry I didn't come along
5981,that day he came to visit you.
5982,1821
5983,"01:38:31,594 --> 01:38:33,805"
5984,V-Visit?
5985,1822
5986,"01:38:33,805 --> 01:38:36,808"
5987,"Oh, you mean the day we met for drinks?"
5988,1823
5989,"01:38:37,725 --> 01:38:39,227"
5990,"Yes, that's what I meant."
5991,1824
5992,"01:38:40,895 --> 01:38:43,648"
5993,"By the way, he has something"
5994,"of yours, you know."
5995,1825
5996,"01:38:43,689 --> 01:38:44,899"
5997,What do you mean?
5998,1826
5999,"01:38:44,941 --> 01:38:47,151"
6000,Don't you know?
6001,1827
6002,"01:38:47,151 --> 01:38:48,486"
6003,No.
6004,1828
6005,"01:38:48,528 --> 01:38:50,238"
6006,Didn't you miss anything that day?
6007,1829
6008,"01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:54,117"
6009,"You don't mean my tie, do you?"
6010,1830
6011,"01:38:55,034 --> 01:38:56,494"
6012,Yes.
6013,1831
6014,"01:38:56,536 --> 01:38:59,831"
6015,"Oh, well, he's got mine,"
6016,and I've got his.
6017,1832
6018,"01:38:59,831 --> 01:39:01,457"
6019,He can have it back.
6020,1833
6021,"01:39:01,499 --> 01:39:03,042"
6022,I'm sorry.
6023,1834
6024,"01:39:03,084 --> 01:39:06,671"
6025,Doesn't matter to me now what
6026,color tie I'm wearing.
6027,1835
6028,"01:39:06,671 --> 01:39:08,965"
6029,I didn't understand.
6030,I thought he'd only borrowed it.
6031,1836
6032,"01:39:09,006 --> 01:39:11,509"
6033,"Oh, no."
6034,It was a trade.
6035,1837
6036,"01:39:12,343 --> 01:39:14,345"
6037,Or...
6038,1838
6039,"01:39:14,387 --> 01:39:15,721"
6040,do you think he stole it?
6041,1839
6042,"01:39:15,763 --> 01:39:17,682"
6043,I have to hang up now.
6044,1840
6045,"01:39:17,723 --> 01:39:20,601"
6046,I just wanted to know if there'd
6047,been any improvement.
6048,1841
6049,"01:39:20,643 --> 01:39:22,728"
6050,"No, no, there isn't."
6051,1842
6052,"01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:24,397"
6053,It was nice of you to call. Bye.
6054,1843
6055,"01:40:02,643 --> 01:40:04,187"
6056,"You aren't in labor, are you?"
6057,1844
6058,"01:40:04,228 --> 01:40:06,939"
6059,"No, but I have to see the doctor."
6060,It's very important.
6061,1845
6062,"01:40:06,981 --> 01:40:08,608"
6063,"But he has to leave at 5:00,"
6064,1846
6065,"01:40:08,649 --> 01:40:10,026"
6066,and there is Mrs. Byron.
6067,1847
6068,"01:40:10,985 --> 01:40:12,403"
6069,I'm sure he'll see you.
6070,Just sit down.
6071,1848
6072,"01:40:12,445 --> 01:40:13,905"
6073,Thank you.
6074,1849
6075,"01:40:35,593 --> 01:40:37,303"
6076,How is it out there?
6077,1850
6078,"01:40:37,887 --> 01:40:39,597"
6079,"Oh, awful. 94."
6080,1851
6081,"01:40:40,139 --> 01:40:41,390"
6082,Ugh!
6083,1852
6084,"01:40:41,432 --> 01:40:42,725"
6085,See you next week.
6086,Make an appointment.
6087,1853
6088,"01:40:42,767 --> 01:40:43,643"
6089,"Yes, I will."
6090,1854
6091,"01:40:50,358 --> 01:40:51,817"
6092,"You're due any day now, aren't you?"
6093,1855
6094,"01:40:51,859 --> 01:40:53,361"
6095,Tuesday.
6096,1856
6097,"01:40:53,402 --> 01:40:55,196"
6098,You're smart to get it
6099,over with before August.
6100,1857
6101,"01:40:57,532 --> 01:40:58,491"
6102,Mrs. Byron.
6103,1858
6104,"01:40:59,534 --> 01:41:00,618"
6105,He'll see you right after.
6106,1859
6107,"01:41:01,827 --> 01:41:03,120"
6108,"Well, let's see, um..."
6109,1860
6110,"01:41:03,829 --> 01:41:05,206"
6111,July the 10th?
6112,1861
6113,"01:41:05,248 --> 01:41:06,624"
6114,What time?
6115,1862
6116,"01:41:06,666 --> 01:41:08,167"
6117,4:00?
6118,Fine.
6119,1863
6120,"01:41:08,209 --> 01:41:09,502"
6121,All right.
6122,See you then.
6123,1864
6124,"01:41:09,544 --> 01:41:10,711"
6125,Thank you.
6126,1865
6127,"01:41:10,753 --> 01:41:12,088"
6128,Bye-bye.
6129,1866
6130,"01:41:12,129 --> 01:41:14,131"
6131,Good luck.
6132,Thank you.
6133,1867
6134,"01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:23,975"
6135,Mmm! That smells nice.
6136,What is it?
6137,1868
6138,"01:41:25,893 --> 01:41:28,145"
6139,"Oh, my--"
6140,It's called Detchema.
6141,1869
6142,"01:41:29,605 --> 01:41:31,190"
6143,"Well, it's a big improvement"
6144,"on your regular,"
6145,1870
6146,"01:41:31,232 --> 01:41:32,483"
6147,if you don't mind my saying.
6148,1871
6149,"01:41:33,484 --> 01:41:34,569"
6150,That wasn't a perfume.
6151,1872
6152,"01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:36,404"
6153,That was a good luck charm.
6154,I threw it away.
6155,1873
6156,"01:41:36,862 --> 01:41:38,531"
6157,Good.
6158,1874
6159,"01:41:38,573 --> 01:41:40,157"
6160,Maybe the doctor will
6161,follow your example.
6162,1875
6163,"01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:47,582"
6164,Dr. Sapirstein?
6165,1876
6166,"01:41:47,623 --> 01:41:50,418"
6167,Yes. The aftershave.
6168,"But it isn't, is it?"
6169,1877
6170,"01:41:50,459 --> 01:41:53,254"
6171,I don't think he has a good luck charm.
6172,1878
6173,"01:41:53,296 --> 01:41:55,131"
6174,"Anyway, he has the same"
6175,smell once in a while.
6176,1879
6177,"01:41:56,674 --> 01:41:58,342"
6178,When he does--
6179,"Oh, boy."
6180,1880
6181,"01:41:59,343 --> 01:42:00,553"
6182,Haven't you ever noticed?
6183,1881
6184,"01:42:00,845 --> 01:42:03,222"
6185,No.
6186,1882
6187,"01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:05,725"
6188,"Well, maybe you thought it was"
6189,your own you were smelling.
6190,1883
6191,"01:42:05,766 --> 01:42:07,560"
6192,"What is it, a chemical thing?"
6193,1884
6194,"01:42:09,312 --> 01:42:11,939"
6195,"Will you excuse me a moment, please?"
6196,1885
6197,"01:42:11,981 --> 01:42:13,733"
6198,My husband is waiting outside.
6199,1886
6200,"01:42:13,774 --> 01:42:15,276"
6201,I have to go and tell him something.
6202,1887
6203,"01:42:15,318 --> 01:42:16,694"
6204,I'll be back in a minute.
6205,1888
6206,"01:43:05,284 --> 01:43:06,494"
6207,Dr. Hill's office.
6208,1889
6209,"01:43:06,535 --> 01:43:07,912"
6210,"Dr. Hill, please."
6211,1890
6212,"01:43:07,953 --> 01:43:09,455"
6213,This is his answering service.
6214,1891
6215,"01:43:09,497 --> 01:43:11,582"
6216,Would you like to leave a message?
6217,1892
6218,"01:43:11,582 --> 01:43:15,961"
6219,"Um, yes. My name is Rosemary Woodhouse."
6220,1893
6221,"01:43:16,003 --> 01:43:17,546"
6222,Woodhouse.
6223,1894
6224,"01:43:17,588 --> 01:43:21,092"
6225,And would you ask him to call
6226,"me back right away, please?"
6227,1895
6228,"01:43:21,133 --> 01:43:26,263"
6229,"Uh, my number is 475-2598."
6230,1896
6231,"01:43:27,348 --> 01:43:29,350"
6232,It's an emergency.
6233,I'm in a phone booth.
6234,1897
6235,"01:43:29,392 --> 01:43:30,518"
6236,All right.
6237,1898
6238,"01:43:40,945 --> 01:43:43,155"
6239,"Quickly, please, Dr. Hill, call me."
6240,1899
6241,"01:43:49,954 --> 01:43:51,956"
6242,"Oh, oh, really?"
6243,1900
6244,"01:43:51,997 --> 01:43:53,666"
6245,Did he really say that?
6246,1901
6247,"01:43:53,708 --> 01:43:56,377"
6248,"Oh, he didn't say that."
6249,1902
6250,"01:43:56,419 --> 01:43:59,088"
6251,What else was it that he said?
6252,1903
6253,"01:43:59,130 --> 01:44:01,048"
6254,"Oh, that's wonderful."
6255,1904
6256,"01:44:01,090 --> 01:44:02,758"
6257,That's wonder--
6258,That's marvelous.
6259,1905
6260,"01:44:04,135 --> 01:44:05,344"
6261,Yes. Dr. Hill?
6262,1906
6263,"01:44:05,386 --> 01:44:06,762"
6264,Did I get the name right?
6265,1907
6266,"01:44:06,804 --> 01:44:08,097"
6267,Is it Rosemary Woodhouse?
6268,1908
6269,"01:44:08,139 --> 01:44:10,433"
6270,Yes.
6271,Are you Dr. Hill's patient?
6272,1909
6273,"01:44:10,766 --> 01:44:12,601"
6274,No.
6275,1910
6276,"01:44:12,643 --> 01:44:15,563"
6277,"Um, yes, I mean, well,"
6278,I've seen him once.
6279,1911
6280,"01:44:15,604 --> 01:44:18,524"
6281,"Um, please, please tell him"
6282,he has to speak to me.
6283,1912
6284,"01:44:18,566 --> 01:44:19,984"
6285,It's important.
6286,1913
6287,"01:44:20,025 --> 01:44:21,777"
6288,"Tell him to call me, hmm?"
6289,1914
6290,"01:44:21,819 --> 01:44:23,487"
6291,All right.
6292,Thank you.
6293,1915
6294,"01:44:30,703 --> 01:44:34,081"
6295,All of them.
6296,All of them.
6297,1916
6298,"01:44:34,123 --> 01:44:37,001"
6299,All in it together.
6300,All of them.
6301,1917
6302,"01:44:37,001 --> 01:44:38,586"
6303,All of them witches.
6304,1918
6305,"01:44:40,171 --> 01:44:41,756"
6306,"Don't you worry, little Andy or Jenny,"
6307,1919
6308,"01:44:41,797 --> 01:44:43,841"
6309,I'll kill them before
6310,I let them touch you.
6311,1920
6312,"01:44:49,096 --> 01:44:50,681"
6313,Yes. Dr--
6314,1921
6315,"01:44:50,681 --> 01:44:52,308"
6316,Mrs. Woodhouse?
6317,Yes!
6318,1922
6319,"01:44:52,349 --> 01:44:55,102"
6320,"Oh, thank you, thank you for calling me."
6321,1923
6322,"01:44:55,144 --> 01:44:56,562"
6323,Thought you were in California.
6324,1924
6325,"01:44:56,604 --> 01:45:00,816"
6326,"No. No, I've been to another doctor,"
6327,1925
6328,"01:45:00,858 --> 01:45:02,943"
6329,"and he isn't good, Dr. Hill."
6330,1926
6331,"01:45:02,985 --> 01:45:04,570"
6332,He's been lying to me
6333,1927
6334,"01:45:04,612 --> 01:45:07,907"
6335,and giving me unusual kinds
6336,of drinks and capsules.
6337,1928
6338,"01:45:08,949 --> 01:45:10,451"
6339,The baby's due on Tuesday.
6340,1929
6341,"01:45:10,493 --> 01:45:12,369"
6342,Remember you told me June 28th?
6343,1930
6344,"01:45:12,411 --> 01:45:13,746"
6345,"Well, I want you to deliver it."
6346,1931
6347,"01:45:13,788 --> 01:45:15,039"
6348,Mrs. Woodhouse--
6349,1932
6350,"01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:18,125"
6351,Please let me talk to you.
6352,1933
6353,"01:45:18,167 --> 01:45:20,711"
6354,Let me come and explain
6355,what's been going on.
6356,1934
6357,"01:45:20,753 --> 01:45:22,505"
6358,I can't stay too long here.
6359,1935
6360,"01:45:22,546 --> 01:45:24,840"
6361,"They'll be coming, looking for me."
6362,1936
6363,"01:45:24,882 --> 01:45:26,300"
6364,Dr. Hill?
6365,1937
6366,"01:45:26,342 --> 01:45:27,718"
6367,"Dr. Hill, there's a plot--"
6368,1938
6369,"01:45:28,469 --> 01:45:30,137"
6370,I know that sounds crazy.
6371,1939
6372,"01:45:30,179 --> 01:45:31,430"
6373,"You're probably thinking,"
6374,1940
6375,"01:45:31,472 --> 01:45:33,557"
6376,"My God, this poor girl
has really flipped,"
6377,1941
6378,"01:45:33,557 --> 01:45:36,560"
6379,"but I haven't flipped,"
6380,"Dr. Hill, I swear."
6381,1942
6382,"01:45:36,602 --> 01:45:38,562"
6383,"By all the saints, I haven't."
6384,1943
6385,"01:45:38,562 --> 01:45:41,148"
6386,There are plots against
6387,"people, aren't there?"
6388,1944
6389,"01:45:41,190 --> 01:45:43,150"
6390,"Yes, I suppose there are."
6391,1945
6392,"01:45:43,192 --> 01:45:45,736"
6393,"Well, then there's one"
6394,against me and my baby.
6395,1946
6396,"01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:49,907"
6397,Come to my office tomorrow after 5:00.
6398,1947
6399,"01:45:49,907 --> 01:45:51,617"
6400,Now! Right now.
6401,1948
6402,"01:45:52,743 --> 01:45:55,120"
6403,"Mrs. Woodhouse, I'm"
6404,not at my office now.
6405,1949
6406,"01:45:55,162 --> 01:45:56,664"
6407,I'm home. I've been up
6408,since yesterday morning.
6409,1950
6410,"01:45:56,705 --> 01:45:57,832"
6411,I beg you.
6412,1951
6413,"01:45:58,582 --> 01:45:59,625"
6414,I beg you.
6415,1952
6416,"01:46:01,085 --> 01:46:02,294"
6417,I can't stay here.
6418,1953
6419,"01:46:04,213 --> 01:46:05,297"
6420,My office at 8:00.
6421,1954
6422,"01:46:05,339 --> 01:46:07,091"
6423,"Yes, thank you."
6424,1955
6425,"01:46:07,091 --> 01:46:08,551"
6426,"Oh, wait! Dr. Hill?"
6427,1956
6428,"01:46:08,592 --> 01:46:09,969"
6429,Yes?
6430,1957
6431,"01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:11,929"
6432,"My husband may call you, asking--"
6433,1958
6434,"01:46:11,971 --> 01:46:13,681"
6435,I'm not gonna speak to anyone.
6436,1959
6437,"01:46:13,722 --> 01:46:15,599"
6438,I'm gonna take a nap.
6439,Thank you.
6440,1960
6441,"01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:51,719"
6442,Keep the change.
6443,1961
6444,"01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,637"
6445,"Uh, driver, please,"
6446,1962
6447,"01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:56,223"
6448,could you wait and watch until--
6449,1963
6450,"01:46:56,265 --> 01:46:57,975"
6451,Until I'm inside the door?
6452,1964
6453,"01:47:14,283 --> 01:47:15,659"
6454,He lied to you.
6455,1965
6456,"01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:17,786"
6457,He said we were going to Hollywood.
6458,1966
6459,"01:47:17,828 --> 01:47:19,997"
6460,"The worst thing of all, he's"
6461,involved with them as well.
6462,1967
6463,"01:47:20,998 --> 01:47:22,207"
6464,He sleeps in pajamas now.
6465,1968
6466,"01:47:22,249 --> 01:47:24,209"
6467,He never used to before.
6468,1969
6469,"01:47:24,251 --> 01:47:25,794"
6470,He's probably hiding a mark.
6471,1970
6472,"01:47:25,836 --> 01:47:28,005"
6473,You know they give you
6474,marks when you join--
6475,1971
6476,"01:47:28,047 --> 01:47:29,506"
6477,All sorts of rituals.
6478,1972
6479,"01:47:29,548 --> 01:47:31,550"
6480,They hold Sabbaths there.
6481,1973
6482,"01:47:31,592 --> 01:47:33,636"
6483,You could hear them singing
6484,through the wall.
6485,1974
6486,"01:47:33,677 --> 01:47:36,555"
6487,"Guy, my husband Guy said"
6488,"it was Dr. Shand,"
6489,1975
6490,"01:47:36,597 --> 01:47:38,349"
6491,one of these people playing a recorder.
6492,1976
6493,"01:47:39,266 --> 01:47:41,393"
6494,"Now, how did he know it was Dr. Shand"
6495,1977
6496,"01:47:41,435 --> 01:47:42,728"
6497,unless he was there with them?
6498,1978
6499,"01:47:44,355 --> 01:47:46,941"
6500,"Um, they're very clever people."
6501,1979
6502,"01:47:46,982 --> 01:47:49,360"
6503,They planned everything
6504,right from the beginning.
6505,1980
6506,"01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:52,613"
6507,They probably made some
6508,sort of deal with Guy.
6509,1981
6510,"01:47:52,655 --> 01:47:55,532"
6511,"They gave him success, and"
6512,he promised them our baby
6513,1982
6514,"01:47:55,574 --> 01:47:57,493"
6515,to use in their rituals.
6516,1983
6517,"01:47:58,369 --> 01:48:00,204"
6518,"I know this sounds crazy,"
6519,1984
6520,"01:48:00,204 --> 01:48:03,082"
6521,but I've-- I've got books here. Look.
6522,1985
6523,"01:48:04,917 --> 01:48:08,379"
6524,There was another actor like
6525,"him, Donald Baumgart,"
6526,1986
6527,"01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:10,547"
6528,and they put a spell on him.
6529,1987
6530,"01:48:10,589 --> 01:48:12,549"
6531,They cast a spell on him
6532,and made him blind
6533,1988
6534,"01:48:12,549 --> 01:48:13,884"
6535,so that Guy could get his part.
6536,1989
6537,"01:48:14,885 --> 01:48:15,886"
6538,"Look, here."
6539,1990
6540,"01:48:18,806 --> 01:48:20,724"
6541,I had this friend Edward Hutchins.
6542,1991
6543,"01:48:20,766 --> 01:48:22,726"
6544,"Maybe you heard of him, a writer."
6545,1992
6546,"01:48:22,726 --> 01:48:24,478"
6547,He wrote stories for boys.
6548,1993
6549,"01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,063"
6550,"Anyway, he was my good friend"
6551,1994
6552,"01:48:26,063 --> 01:48:27,314"
6553,since I first came to New York.
6554,1995
6555,"01:48:27,398 --> 01:48:28,649"
6556,May I keep this?
6557,1996
6558,"01:48:28,691 --> 01:48:32,361"
6559,"Yes, please, and, look, anyway,"
6560,1997
6561,"01:48:32,403 --> 01:48:34,655"
6562,once Mr. Hutchins came to visit me--
6563,1998
6564,"01:48:36,156 --> 01:48:37,449"
6565,Came to visit me.
6566,1999
6567,"01:48:37,449 --> 01:48:39,994"
6568,It was the time I was having
6569,"this pain, Doctor."
6570,2000
6571,"01:48:40,035 --> 01:48:41,203"
6572,I was suffering so--
6573,2001
6574,"01:48:41,203 --> 01:48:43,539"
6575,You can't imagine how
6576,"much I was suffering,"
6577,2002
6578,"01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:45,916"
6579,and they wouldn't help me. Nobody would.
6580,2003
6581,"01:48:45,958 --> 01:48:48,836"
6582,They were giving me a drink
6583,with tannis root in it.
6584,2004
6585,"01:48:48,877 --> 01:48:52,047"
6586,"Also witches' stuff, tannis root."
6587,2005
6588,"01:48:52,089 --> 01:48:55,634"
6589,"Hutch came, and he immediately"
6590,saw something was wrong.
6591,2006
6592,"01:48:55,676 --> 01:48:57,511"
6593,"He-- He knew about witches, you see."
6594,2007
6595,"01:48:57,553 --> 01:49:00,514"
6596,"Suddenly, Guy rushed in"
6597,"with his makeup still on,"
6598,2008
6599,"01:49:00,556 --> 01:49:01,765"
6600,which he never did.
6601,2009
6602,"01:49:01,807 --> 01:49:04,393"
6603,They probably called him to come home
6604,2010
6605,"01:49:04,435 --> 01:49:06,061"
6606,"and steal one of Hutch's belongings,"
6607,2011
6608,"01:49:06,103 --> 01:49:07,855"
6609,which he did.
6610,"Took his glove,"
6611,2012
6612,"01:49:07,896 --> 01:49:10,107"
6613,"and they put a spell on him, too."
6614,2013
6615,"01:49:10,149 --> 01:49:12,818"
6616,Put him in a coma.
6617,"Three months later, he died."
6618,2014
6619,"01:49:14,778 --> 01:49:17,281"
6620,"Now, maybe all of this is coincidence,"
6621,2015
6622,"01:49:17,281 --> 01:49:18,532"
6623,but one thing is for sure.
6624,2016
6625,"01:49:18,574 --> 01:49:20,451"
6626,"They have a coven, and"
6627,they want my baby.
6628,2017
6629,"01:49:24,163 --> 01:49:25,581"
6630,Certainly seems that way.
6631,2018
6632,"01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:38,635"
6633,I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.
6634,2019
6635,"01:49:38,635 --> 01:49:40,345"
6636,"I don't believe in witchcraft,"
6637,2020
6638,"01:49:40,387 --> 01:49:42,806"
6639,but there are plenty of maniacs
6640,and crazy people in this city.
6641,2021
6642,"01:49:44,266 --> 01:49:45,684"
6643,"The doctor's name is Shand, you say?"
6644,2022
6645,"01:49:45,726 --> 01:49:49,146"
6646,"N-No, Dr. Shand is one of these people."
6647,2023
6648,"01:49:49,188 --> 01:49:50,689"
6649,The doctor's name is Sapirstein.
6650,2024
6651,"01:49:52,274 --> 01:49:53,525"
6652,Abraham Sapirstein?
6653,2025
6654,"01:49:54,151 --> 01:49:55,486"
6655,Yeah.
6656,2026
6657,"01:49:56,987 --> 01:49:58,280"
6658,Do you know him?
6659,2027
6660,"01:49:58,322 --> 01:49:59,823"
6661,I've met him once or twice.
6662,2028
6663,"01:50:00,699 --> 01:50:02,576"
6664,"To look at him, you'd never think he--"
6665,2029
6666,"01:50:02,618 --> 01:50:04,495"
6667,"No, you wouldn't."
6668,Not in a million years.
6669,2030
6670,"01:50:05,871 --> 01:50:07,998"
6671,Would you like to go into
6672,"Mount Sinai right now,"
6673,2031
6674,"01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:08,999"
6675,this evening?
6676,2032
6677,"01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,295"
6678,"Yeah, I would love to."
6679,Would that be possible?
6680,2033
6681,"01:50:13,337 --> 01:50:14,838"
6682,"It's difficult, but we'll try."
6683,2034
6684,"01:50:16,423 --> 01:50:17,841"
6685,I want you to lie down
6686,and get some rest.
6687,2035
6688,"01:50:17,883 --> 01:50:20,177"
6689,Thanks.
6690,2036
6691,"01:50:20,177 --> 01:50:23,514"
6692,"Anything they've got, even"
6693,a broom closet'd be fine.
6694,2037
6695,"01:50:23,514 --> 01:50:25,015"
6696,I hope we can do better than that.
6697,2038
6698,"01:50:31,939 --> 01:50:34,024"
6699,"I'll see what I can do,"
6700,then I'll check you over.
6701,2039
6702,"01:50:37,694 --> 01:50:39,822"
6703,"Oh, should I undress now?"
6704,2040
6705,"01:50:39,863 --> 01:50:41,740"
6706,No. It'll take me about a half
6707,an hour on the telephone.
6708,2041
6709,"01:50:41,782 --> 01:50:42,908"
6710,"You just lie down, rest."
6711,2042
6712,"01:50:45,702 --> 01:50:46,829"
6713,Okay?
6714,2043
6715,"01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:47,913"
6716,Okay.
6717,2044
6718,"01:50:56,588 --> 01:50:58,507"
6719,God bless Dr. Hill.
6720,2045
6721,"01:51:05,055 --> 01:51:07,641"
6722,Everything's going to be
6723,"okay, now, Andy or Jenny."
6724,2046
6725,"01:51:08,725 --> 01:51:11,562"
6726,We're going to be in
6727,"a nice, clean hospital"
6728,2047
6729,"01:51:11,603 --> 01:51:13,188"
6730,with no visitors.
6731,2048
6732,"01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:17,693"
6733,Oh.
6734,2049
6735,"01:51:35,085 --> 01:51:36,170"
6736,Monsters.
6737,2050
6738,"01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:40,757"
6739,Monsters.
6740,2051
6741,"01:51:44,261 --> 01:51:45,804"
6742,Unspeakable.
6743,2052
6744,"01:51:46,889 --> 01:51:48,098"
6745,Unspeakable.
6746,2053
6747,"01:52:20,464 --> 01:52:21,882"
6748,I was sleeping.
6749,2054
6750,"01:52:36,813 --> 01:52:38,941"
6751,"Come with us quietly, Rosemary."
6752,2055
6753,"01:52:38,982 --> 01:52:41,151"
6754,Don't argue or make a scene
6755,2056
6756,"01:52:41,151 --> 01:52:43,820"
6757,because if you say anything more
6758,"about witches or witchcraft,"
6759,2057
6760,"01:52:43,862 --> 01:52:46,281"
6761,we're going to be forced to take
6762,you to a mental hospital.
6763,2058
6764,"01:52:46,323 --> 01:52:47,491"
6765,"You don't want that, do you?"
6766,2059
6767,"01:52:47,532 --> 01:52:49,660"
6768,So put your shoes on.
6769,2060
6770,"01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:51,662"
6771,We just want to take you home.
6772,2061
6773,"01:52:51,703 --> 01:52:52,996"
6774,No one's going to hurt you.
6775,2062
6776,"01:52:53,038 --> 01:52:54,790"
6777,Or the baby.
6778,Put your shoes on.
6779,2063
6780,"01:53:14,351 --> 01:53:16,019"
6781,She's fine now.
6782,2064
6783,"01:53:16,061 --> 01:53:18,272"
6784,We're going to go home and rest.
6785,2065
6786,"01:53:18,313 --> 01:53:19,690"
6787,That's all it takes.
6788,2066
6789,"01:53:19,690 --> 01:53:21,441"
6790,"Thank you for your trouble, Doctor."
6791,2067
6792,"01:53:21,483 --> 01:53:22,943"
6793,"Glad I could be of help, sir."
6794,2068
6795,"01:53:22,985 --> 01:53:24,861"
6796,It's a shame you had to
6797,come in here.
6798,2069
6799,"01:54:18,415 --> 01:54:19,166"
6800,"Good evening, Mrs. Woodhouse."
6801,2070
6802,"01:54:35,307 --> 01:54:36,433"
6803,Mrs. Woodhouse!
6804,2071
6805,"01:54:37,893 --> 01:54:39,269"
6806,Mrs. Woodhouse!
6807,2072
6808,"01:55:04,961 --> 01:55:05,962"
6809,Uhh!
6810,2073
6811,"01:55:43,708 --> 01:55:45,001"
6812,Ro!
6813,2074
6814,"01:55:45,043 --> 01:55:48,797"
6815,Ro! Ro!
6816,2075
6817,"01:55:48,839 --> 01:55:50,340"
6818,"Ro, baby, Ro!"
6819,2076
6820,"01:55:51,341 --> 01:55:52,467"
6821,Ro!
6822,2077
6823,"01:55:56,012 --> 01:55:58,014"
6824,"Come on, open up, Ro."
6825,Go to hell!
6826,2078
6827,"01:55:58,056 --> 01:55:59,099"
6828,"Come on, honey."
6829,No one's going to hurt you.
6830,2079
6831,"01:55:59,141 --> 01:56:02,018"
6832,"You promised them the baby, get out!"
6833,2080
6834,"01:56:02,018 --> 01:56:03,228"
6835,"No, I didn't promise them anything."
6836,2081
6837,"01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:04,312"
6838,What are you talking about?
6839,Promised who?
6840,2082
6841,"01:56:04,354 --> 01:56:05,522"
6842,"Rosemary, you're--"
6843,2083
6844,"01:56:38,555 --> 01:56:40,223"
6845,Hello.
6846,Elise.
6847,2084
6848,"01:56:40,265 --> 01:56:42,767"
6849,Mrs. Dunstan is out.
6850,Who is this?
6851,2085
6852,"01:56:42,809 --> 01:56:44,561"
6853,The babysitter.
6854,Do you know where she went?
6855,2086
6856,"01:56:44,603 --> 01:56:46,354"
6857,They went to the movies.
6858,2087
6859,"01:56:46,396 --> 01:56:49,191"
6860,This is Rosemary.
6861,Please ask her to call Rosemary
6862,2088
6863,"01:56:49,232 --> 01:56:50,942"
6864,the second she gets home.
6865,2089
6866,"01:56:50,984 --> 01:56:54,154"
6867,It's terribly urgent. Don't--
6868,Don't forget.
6869,2090
6870,"01:56:54,196 --> 01:56:55,489"
6871,Don't worry.
6872,I'll tell her.
6873,2091
6874,"01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:56,448"
6875,Thank you.
6876,2092
6877,"01:57:03,663 --> 01:57:05,040"
6878,"We don't want to hurt you, Ro."
6879,2093
6880,"01:57:06,249 --> 01:57:08,418"
6881,"We're your friends, Rosemary."
6882,2094
6883,"01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:10,629"
6884,There's nothing to be
6885,"afraid of, Rosemary."
6886,2095
6887,"01:57:10,670 --> 01:57:12,255"
6888,Honest and truly there isn't.
6889,2096
6890,"01:57:12,255 --> 01:57:14,799"
6891,This is nothing but a mild
6892,sedative to calm you down.
6893,2097
6894,"01:57:14,841 --> 01:57:15,759"
6895,You know I wouldn't let any--
6896,2098
6897,"01:57:15,759 --> 01:57:18,261"
6898,Ro.
6899,2099
6900,"01:57:18,261 --> 01:57:19,387"
6901,Aah!
6902,2100
6903,"01:57:19,429 --> 01:57:20,889"
6904,"Ro, Ro!"
6905,2101
6906,"01:57:20,931 --> 01:57:23,350"
6907,Help me!
6908,"Oh, Ro, baby."
6909,2102
6910,"01:57:23,391 --> 01:57:25,644"
6911,"Somebody, help me!"
6912,2103
6913,"01:57:25,685 --> 01:57:28,188"
6914,Aah!
6915,2104
6916,"01:57:37,197 --> 01:57:38,240"
6917,Wait a minute.
6918,2105
6919,"01:57:38,782 --> 01:57:40,492"
6920,Wait a minute now.
6921,2106
6922,"01:57:46,331 --> 01:57:47,874"
6923,We happen to be in labor here.
6924,2107
6925,"01:57:47,916 --> 01:57:49,167"
6926,Here?
6927,2108
6928,"01:57:49,209 --> 01:57:51,628"
6929,Here.
6930,"You're all right, baby."
6931,2109
6932,"01:57:51,670 --> 01:57:54,256"
6933,You're gonna be perfectly all right.
6934,I swear to God you will.
6935,2110
6936,"01:57:54,297 --> 01:57:56,299"
6937,There were supposed to
6938,"be doctors, hospitals!"
6939,2111
6940,"01:57:56,341 --> 01:57:59,469"
6941,"Doctors, hospitals!"
6942,2112
6943,"01:57:59,469 --> 01:58:01,388"
6944,Everything-- Everything's
6945,clean and sterile!
6946,2113
6947,"01:58:02,556 --> 01:58:04,808"
6948,"No, she isn't here, Elise."
6949,2114
6950,"01:58:04,808 --> 01:58:05,976"
6951,I'll have her call you back.
6952,2115
6953,"01:58:11,898 --> 01:58:13,692"
6954,"Oh, Andy..."
6955,2116
6956,"01:58:13,733 --> 01:58:15,318"
6957,Andy or Jenny...
6958,2117
6959,"01:58:16,278 --> 01:58:19,281"
6960,"I-I'm sorry, my little darling."
6961,2118
6962,"01:58:20,657 --> 01:58:21,992"
6963,Forgive me!
6964,2119
6965,"01:58:33,503 --> 01:58:34,588"
6966,Hi.
6967,2120
6968,"01:58:40,343 --> 01:58:41,678"
6969,Hi.
6970,2121
6971,"01:58:43,513 --> 01:58:45,557"
6972,Is it all right?
6973,2122
6974,"01:58:47,017 --> 01:58:49,311"
6975,"Yes, it's fine."
6976,2123
6977,"01:58:52,355 --> 01:58:53,440"
6978,What is it?
6979,2124
6980,"01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:55,442"
6981,A boy.
6982,2125
6983,"01:59:00,030 --> 01:59:02,449"
6984,Really? A boy.
6985,2126
6986,"01:59:12,792 --> 01:59:14,085"
6987,And it's all right?
6988,2127
6989,"01:59:14,669 --> 01:59:15,712"
6990,Yes.
6991,2128
6992,"01:59:35,649 --> 01:59:36,816"
6993,Where is it?
6994,2129
6995,"01:59:36,858 --> 01:59:40,570"
6996,"Ohh! Oh, my goodness."
6997,2130
6998,"01:59:40,570 --> 01:59:43,323"
6999,"Oh, gee, what a start you"
7000,gave me. My goodness.
7001,2131
7002,"01:59:43,365 --> 01:59:45,325"
7003,"The baby, where is it?"
7004,2132
7005,"01:59:45,367 --> 01:59:48,411"
7006,"Oh, uh, you wait here one minute."
7007,2133
7008,"01:59:50,789 --> 01:59:51,998"
7009,Where's my baby?
7010,2134
7011,"01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:54,834"
7012,"Uh, I'll go find Dr. Abe."
7013,2135
7014,"01:59:54,876 --> 01:59:56,336"
7015,Ju-Just wait.
7016,2136
7017,"02:00:12,811 --> 02:00:13,687"
7018,Where's the baby?
7019,2137
7020,"02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:18,608"
7021,Where is it?
7022,2138
7023,"02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:20,402"
7024,Honey--
7025,2139
7026,"02:00:21,945 --> 02:00:23,613"
7027,"There were complications,"
7028,"Rosemary,"
7029,2140
7030,"02:00:23,655 --> 02:00:25,240"
7031,but nothing that will
7032,affect future births.
7033,2141
7034,"02:00:28,868 --> 02:00:30,120"
7035,It's--
7036,2142
7037,"02:00:32,038 --> 02:00:33,748"
7038,Dead.
7039,2143
7040,"02:00:33,790 --> 02:00:35,041"
7041,It was in the wrong position.
7042,2144
7043,"02:00:35,083 --> 02:00:37,001"
7044,In the hospital I might have been
7045,"able to do something about it,"
7046,2145
7047,"02:00:37,043 --> 02:00:38,294"
7048,but you wouldn't listen.
7049,2146
7050,"02:00:38,336 --> 02:00:39,754"
7051,"Honey, we can have others"
7052,as soon as you're better.
7053,2147
7054,"02:00:39,796 --> 02:00:41,047"
7055,I promise you.
7056,2148
7057,"02:00:41,089 --> 02:00:41,840"
7058,Absolutely.
7059,2149
7060,"02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:43,299"
7061,You can start on another
7062,in a very few months.
7063,2150
7064,"02:00:43,299 --> 02:00:44,843"
7065,As soon as you're better.
7066,2151
7067,"02:00:44,884 --> 02:00:46,136"
7068,No.
7069,2152
7070,"02:00:47,554 --> 02:00:49,597"
7071,I don't believe you.
7072,You're both lying.
7073,2153
7074,"02:00:49,639 --> 02:00:52,142"
7075,You're lying!
7076,It didn't die!
7077,2154
7078,"02:00:52,142 --> 02:00:53,351"
7079,You took it!
7080,2155
7081,"02:00:53,393 --> 02:00:56,229"
7082,You're lying!
7083,You're witches!
7084,2156
7085,"02:00:56,229 --> 02:00:57,647"
7086,You're lying!
7087,2157
7088,"02:00:57,647 --> 02:01:02,318"
7089,You're lying! You're lying!
7090,You're lying!
7091,2158
7092,"02:01:11,327 --> 02:01:15,165"
7093,Abe says it's called prepartum.
7094,2159
7095,"02:01:15,165 --> 02:01:17,333"
7096,I don't know.
7097,It's some kind of a hysteria.
7098,2160
7099,"02:01:18,668 --> 02:01:21,504"
7100,"Boy, you were really kapow,"
7101,out of your mind.
7102,2161
7103,"02:01:25,091 --> 02:01:29,345"
7104,"Uh, I know where you got the idea"
7105,"that Minnie and Roman were witches,"
7106,2162
7107,"02:01:31,514 --> 02:01:33,850"
7108,"but, um, how come you thought that"
7109,Abe and I joined the party?
7110,2163
7111,"02:01:38,146 --> 02:01:41,107"
7112,"Um, let's face it, darling."
7113,2164
7114,"02:01:41,149 --> 02:01:44,360"
7115,You had the prepartum crazies.
7116,2165
7117,"02:01:45,945 --> 02:01:48,364"
7118,"Now you're going to rest, and"
7119,you're going to get over them.
7120,2166
7121,"02:01:50,784 --> 02:01:53,870"
7122,I know this is the worst thing
7123,"that ever happened to you,"
7124,2167
7125,"02:01:53,912 --> 02:01:56,581"
7126,"but from now on, everything's"
7127,going to be roses.
7128,2168
7129,"02:01:56,623 --> 02:01:58,625"
7130,Paramount's within an inch
7131,"of where we want them,"
7132,2169
7133,"02:01:58,666 --> 02:02:00,960"
7134,and suddenly Universal's
7135,"interested, too,"
7136,2170
7137,"02:02:01,002 --> 02:02:02,462"
7138,"and we're going to blow this town,"
7139,2171
7140,"02:02:02,504 --> 02:02:04,714"
7141,and we're going to be in the
7142,beautiful hills of Beverly
7143,2172
7144,"02:02:04,756 --> 02:02:08,009"
7145,"with a pool, a spice garden,"
7146,"the whole schmeer,"
7147,2173
7148,"02:02:08,051 --> 02:02:10,053"
7149,"and the kids, too, Ro."
7150,2174
7151,"02:02:10,094 --> 02:02:12,222"
7152,Scout's honor.
7153,You heard what Abe said.
7154,2175
7155,"02:02:16,226 --> 02:02:18,520"
7156,"Now, I got to run now and get famous."
7157,2176
7158,"02:02:22,065 --> 02:02:23,900"
7159,Let me see your shoulder.
7160,2177
7161,"02:02:27,362 --> 02:02:28,780"
7162,Let me see your shoulder.
7163,2178
7164,"02:02:29,697 --> 02:02:31,074"
7165,Are you kidding?
7166,2179
7167,"02:02:31,074 --> 02:02:32,408"
7168,Your left shoulder.
7169,2180
7170,"02:02:33,910 --> 02:02:35,537"
7171,All right.
7172,Anything you say.
7173,2181
7174,"02:02:39,457 --> 02:02:40,917"
7175,I generally prefer doing this to music.
7176,2182
7177,"02:02:42,335 --> 02:02:43,670"
7178,Left shoulder.
7179,2183
7180,"02:02:46,714 --> 02:02:47,799"
7181,Right shoulder.
7182,2184
7183,"02:02:51,594 --> 02:02:53,555"
7184,And that's as far as I go
7185,without a blue light.
7186,2185
7187,"02:02:59,102 --> 02:03:01,729"
7188,The high pressure area that we see here
7189,2186
7190,"02:03:01,771 --> 02:03:03,439"
7191,has been causing this extreme
7192,heat and humidity.
7193,2187
7194,"02:03:04,274 --> 02:03:07,318"
7195,And unfortunately will be staying
7196,with us city dwellers
7197,2188
7198,"02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:08,862"
7199,through the rest of the week.
7200,2189
7201,"02:03:08,903 --> 02:03:12,282"
7202,It will be hot and overcast
7203,upstate New York as well
7204,2190
7205,"02:03:12,282 --> 02:03:15,785"
7206,with the possibility of thunder
7207,showers tonight and tomorrow
7208,2191
7209,"02:03:15,827 --> 02:03:18,788"
7210,with gradual clearing by tomorrow night.
7211,2192
7212,"02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:22,083"
7213,All you people leaving the city this
7214,upcoming weekend should find it hot.
7215,2193
7216,"02:03:46,441 --> 02:03:48,610"
7217,Do you hear a baby crying?
7218,2194
7219,"02:03:49,819 --> 02:03:52,363"
7220,"Why, no, I don't, dear."
7221,2195
7222,"02:03:52,405 --> 02:03:54,324"
7223,"Now, you come and get into your bed now."
7224,2196
7225,"02:03:54,365 --> 02:03:55,617"
7226,It's time for you to take your pill.
7227,2197
7228,"02:04:06,502 --> 02:04:09,255"
7229,Did you turn the air conditioner off?
7230,Mm-hmm.
7231,2198
7232,"02:04:09,297 --> 02:04:11,424"
7233,"Well, you mustn't do that, dear."
7234,2199
7235,"02:04:11,466 --> 02:04:13,885"
7236,"Why, people are actually"
7237,"dying, it's so hot."
7238,2200
7239,"02:04:29,651 --> 02:04:31,361"
7240,What do you do with the milk?
7241,2201
7242,"02:04:31,402 --> 02:04:34,364"
7243,"Why, uh, throw it away."
7244,2202
7245,"02:04:34,364 --> 02:04:35,657"
7246,"Your pill, Rosemary."
7247,2203
7248,"02:04:43,456 --> 02:04:46,042"
7249,"Hello, girls."
7250,2204
7251,"02:04:46,918 --> 02:04:49,379"
7252,Whew. 95 out.
7253,2205
7254,"02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:52,382"
7255,Some new people moved on in up in 8.
7256,2206
7257,"02:04:54,008 --> 02:04:55,468"
7258,Do they have a baby?
7259,2207
7260,"02:04:57,929 --> 02:04:58,930"
7261,How'd you know that?
7262,2208
7263,"02:05:00,890 --> 02:05:02,100"
7264,I heard it crying.
7265,2209
7266,"02:05:03,226 --> 02:05:04,394"
7267,"Oh, wait a minute."
7268,2210
7269,"02:05:08,481 --> 02:05:11,609"
7270,"Oh, no."
7271,Don't do that.
7272,2211
7273,"02:05:11,651 --> 02:05:13,236"
7274,Why not?
7275,2212
7276,"02:05:13,236 --> 02:05:16,030"
7277,"Uh, a little messy, that's all."
7278,2213
7279,"02:08:06,534 --> 02:08:07,994"
7280,"Easy, easy."
7281,2214
7282,"02:08:25,970 --> 02:08:27,930"
7283,Got her too high.
7284,2215
7285,"02:08:48,117 --> 02:08:50,953"
7286,Not if he's still waiting
7287,"for a plane, he isn't."
7288,2216
7289,"02:08:53,414 --> 02:08:55,833"
7290,"Oh, hell, now, Hayato."
7291,2217
7292,"02:08:55,875 --> 02:08:57,376"
7293,You're just making fun of me.
7294,2218
7295,"02:08:57,418 --> 02:08:59,045"
7296,"You're pulling my leg, like we say."
7297,2219
7298,"02:09:25,446 --> 02:09:26,989"
7299,Aah!
7300,2220
7301,"02:09:28,908 --> 02:09:31,285"
7302,"Rosemary, go back to bed."
7303,2221
7304,"02:09:31,327 --> 02:09:33,496"
7305,You know you're not supposed
7306,to be up and around.
7307,2222
7308,"02:09:33,496 --> 02:09:35,831"
7309,Is the mother?
7310,"Uh, Rosemary--"
7311,2223
7312,"02:09:35,873 --> 02:09:38,084"
7313,Shut up.
7314,You're in Dubrovnik.
7315,2224
7316,"02:09:38,084 --> 02:09:39,168"
7317,I don't hear you.
7318,2225
7319,"02:10:24,297 --> 02:10:25,715"
7320,What have you done to it?
7321,2226
7322,"02:10:26,924 --> 02:10:28,884"
7323,What have you done to its eyes?
7324,2227
7325,"02:10:28,884 --> 02:10:30,720"
7326,He has his father's eyes.
7327,2228
7328,"02:10:36,392 --> 02:10:37,560"
7329,What are you talking about?
7330,2229
7331,"02:10:37,601 --> 02:10:39,228"
7332,Guy's eyes are normal.
7333,2230
7334,"02:10:39,270 --> 02:10:43,065"
7335,"What have you done to him,"
7336,you maniacs?
7337,2231
7338,"02:10:43,065 --> 02:10:45,985"
7339,"Satan is his father, not Guy."
7340,2232
7341,"02:10:46,027 --> 02:10:49,530"
7342,He came up from hell and begat
7343,a son of mortal woman.
7344,2233
7345,"02:10:49,572 --> 02:10:50,573"
7346,"Hail, Satan!"
7347,2234
7348,"02:10:50,614 --> 02:10:51,991"
7349,"Hail, Satan!"
7350,2235
7351,"02:10:52,033 --> 02:10:55,911"
7352,"Satan is his father, and"
7353,his name is Adrian.
7354,2236
7355,"02:10:55,911 --> 02:10:58,831"
7356,He shall overthrow the mighty
7357,and lay waste their temples.
7358,2237
7359,"02:10:58,873 --> 02:11:02,668"
7360,He shall redeem the despised
7361,and wreak vengeance
7362,2238
7363,"02:11:02,710 --> 02:11:05,254"
7364,in the name of the burned
7365,and the tortured!
7366,2239
7367,"02:11:05,296 --> 02:11:06,630"
7368,"Hail, Adrian!"
7369,2240
7370,"02:11:06,672 --> 02:11:07,757"
7371,"Hail, Adrian!"
7372,2241
7373,"02:11:07,798 --> 02:11:09,508"
7374,"Hail, Satan!"
7375,"Hail, Satan!"
7376,2242
7377,"02:11:09,550 --> 02:11:10,801"
7378,"Hail, Satan!"
7379,2243
7380,"02:11:10,843 --> 02:11:13,888"
7381,He chose you out of all the world.
7382,2244
7383,"02:11:13,929 --> 02:11:15,973"
7384,Out of all the women in the
7385,"whole world, he chose you."
7386,2245
7387,"02:11:16,015 --> 02:11:17,725"
7388,He arranged things because he wanted you
7389,2246
7390,"02:11:17,767 --> 02:11:19,268"
7391,to be the mother of his only living son.
7392,2247
7393,"02:11:19,268 --> 02:11:21,604"
7394,His power is stronger than stronger!
7395,2248
7396,"02:11:21,604 --> 02:11:24,273"
7397,His might shall last longer than longer!
7398,2249
7399,"02:11:24,315 --> 02:11:25,733"
7400,"Hail, Satan!"
7401,2250
7402,"02:11:26,525 --> 02:11:28,319"
7403,No!
7404,2251
7405,"02:11:28,361 --> 02:11:30,738"
7406,It can't be!
7407,2252
7408,"02:11:31,322 --> 02:11:32,948"
7409,No!
7410,2253
7411,"02:11:32,948 --> 02:11:34,283"
7412,Go look at his hands.
7413,2254
7414,"02:11:34,325 --> 02:11:35,326"
7415,And his feet.
7416,2255
7417,"02:11:37,703 --> 02:11:40,081"
7418,"Oh, God!"
7419,2256
7420,"02:11:41,749 --> 02:11:45,461"
7421,God is dead!
7422,Satan lives!
7423,2257
7424,"02:11:45,503 --> 02:11:46,796"
7425,The year is one!
7426,2258
7427,"02:11:46,837 --> 02:11:48,506"
7428,"Hail, Satan!"
7429,"Hail, Satan!"
7430,2259
7431,"02:11:48,547 --> 02:11:50,299"
7432,"The year is one, and God is done!"
7433,2260
7434,"02:11:50,299 --> 02:11:51,592"
7435,"Oh, God!"
7436,2261
7437,"02:11:51,634 --> 02:11:52,885"
7438,The year is one!
7439,2262
7440,"02:11:52,927 --> 02:11:56,305"
7441,"Hail, Adrian!"
7442,2263
7443,"02:11:56,305 --> 02:11:58,057"
7444,"Hail, Satan!"
7445,2264
7446,"02:11:58,099 --> 02:12:00,810"
7447,"Why don't you help us out,"
7448,Rosemary?
7449,2265
7450,"02:12:00,851 --> 02:12:02,978"
7451,Be a real mother to Adrian.
7452,2266
7453,"02:12:02,978 --> 02:12:04,814"
7454,You don't have to join
7455,if you don't want to.
7456,2267
7457,"02:12:04,855 --> 02:12:06,982"
7458,Just be a mother to your baby.
7459,2268
7460,"02:12:08,901 --> 02:12:11,946"
7461,Minnie and Laura-Louise are too old.
7462,2269
7463,"02:12:12,613 --> 02:12:13,948"
7464,It's not right.
7465,2270
7466,"02:12:16,784 --> 02:12:17,952"
7467,"Think about it, Rosemary."
7468,2271
7469,"02:12:31,465 --> 02:12:33,509"
7470,"Oh, God!"
7471,2272
7472,"02:12:33,509 --> 02:12:34,885"
7473,"Oh, shut up with your ""Oh, Gods,"""
7474,2273
7475,"02:12:34,927 --> 02:12:36,220"
7476,"or we'll kill you, milk or no milk."
7477,2274
7478,"02:12:36,262 --> 02:12:37,471"
7479,You shut up.
7480,2275
7481,"02:12:37,513 --> 02:12:39,515"
7482,"Rosemary's his mother, so"
7483,you show some respect.
7484,2276
7485,"02:12:42,852 --> 02:12:44,687"
7486,"Come, my friend."
7487,2277
7488,"02:12:44,687 --> 02:12:47,022"
7489,Come see him.
7490,Come see the child.
7491,2278
7492,"02:12:57,408 --> 02:12:59,368"
7493,What would you like to drink?
7494,2279
7495,"02:13:00,453 --> 02:13:02,705"
7496,"They, uh, promised me"
7497,"you wouldn't be hurt,"
7498,2280
7499,"02:13:02,705 --> 02:13:04,832"
7500,"and you haven't been, really."
7501,2281
7502,"02:13:06,709 --> 02:13:09,044"
7503,"I mean, supposing you had"
7504,"the baby, and you lost it."
7505,2282
7506,"02:13:10,754 --> 02:13:12,131"
7507,Wouldn't that be the same?
7508,2283
7509,"02:13:13,257 --> 02:13:14,925"
7510,And we're getting so much
7511,"in return, Ro."
7512,2284
7513,"02:13:26,437 --> 02:13:30,274"
7514,"Oh, Guy, let me introduce you"
7515,to Argyron Stavropoulos.
7516,2285
7517,"02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:33,068"
7518,How proud you must be.
7519,2286
7520,"02:13:33,068 --> 02:13:34,987"
7521,Is this the mother?
7522,2287
7523,"02:13:35,029 --> 02:13:36,572"
7524,Why in the name of--
7525,2288
7526,"02:13:36,614 --> 02:13:38,574"
7527,"Here, drink this."
7528,You'll feel a little better.
7529,2289
7530,"02:13:38,616 --> 02:13:39,909"
7531,What's in it?
7532,Tannis root?
7533,2290
7534,"02:13:39,950 --> 02:13:41,327"
7535,Nothing's in it.
7536,2291
7537,"02:13:41,368 --> 02:13:43,579"
7538,"Just plain, ordinary Lipton's"
7539,tea. You drink it.
7540,2292
7541,"02:14:15,861 --> 02:14:18,239"
7542,Get away from here.
7543,Roman.
7544,2293
7545,"02:14:18,280 --> 02:14:20,699"
7546,You're rocking him too fast.
7547,2294
7548,"02:14:20,741 --> 02:14:22,785"
7549,Sit down. Get her out of here.
7550,2295
7551,"02:14:22,826 --> 02:14:23,953"
7552,Put her where she belongs.
7553,2296
7554,"02:14:23,994 --> 02:14:25,454"
7555,You're rocking him too fast.
7556,2297
7557,"02:14:25,496 --> 02:14:26,705"
7558,That's why he's crying.
7559,2298
7560,"02:14:26,747 --> 02:14:27,790"
7561,"Oh, mind your own business."
7562,2299
7563,"02:14:27,790 --> 02:14:29,667"
7564,Let Rosemary rock him.
7565,2300
7566,"02:14:29,708 --> 02:14:30,918"
7567,"Go on, sit down with the others."
7568,2301
7569,"02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:32,127"
7570,Let Rosemary rock him.
7571,2302
7572,"02:14:32,127 --> 02:14:33,295"
7573,"Well, she's liable to--"
7574,2303
7575,"02:14:33,295 --> 02:14:35,422"
7576,"Sit down with the others,"
7577,Laura-Louise.
7578,2304
7579,"02:14:45,724 --> 02:14:47,101"
7580,Rock him.
7581,2305
7582,"02:14:49,895 --> 02:14:51,647"
7583,You're trying to get me
7584,to be his mother.
7585,2306
7586,"02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:55,192"
7587,Aren't you his mother?
