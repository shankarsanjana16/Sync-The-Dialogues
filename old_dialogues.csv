1
"00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,726"
Are you a doctor?

2
"00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:23,852"
Yes. Yes.

3
"00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,062"
He's an actor.

4
"00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,897"
"Oh, an actor."

5
"00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,732"
We're very popular with actors.

6
"00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,525"
"Have I, uh, seen you in anything?"

7
"00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,528"
Let's see. I did Hamlet a
"while back, didn't I, Liz?"

8
"00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,073"
"And then we did, the, uh,"
The Sandpiper.

9
"00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,033"
He's joking.
He was in Luther

10
"00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,743"
and Nobody Loves an Albatross

11
"00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,245"
and a lot of television
plays and commercials.

12
"00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,081"
"Well, that's where the money"
"is, isn't it? Commercials."

13
"00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,791"
"And the artistic thrills, too."

14
"00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,383"
"7, Diego."

15
"00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,259"
"Originally, the smallest"
apartment was a 9.

16
"00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,637"
They've been broken up into
"four, fives, and sixes."

17
"00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,223"
"Now, 7-E is a four,"

18
"00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,558"
originally the back part of a 10.

19
"00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,519"
It has the original dining
"room for its living room,"

20
"00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,604"
"another bedroom for the bedroom,"

21
"00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,272"
and two servants' rooms
thrown together

22
"00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,108"
for a dining room or a second bedroom.

23
"00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,110"
Do you have children?

24
"00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,153"
"Uh, we plan to."

25
"00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,657"
"We must oil that gate,"
Diego.

26
"00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,828"
"This way, please."

27
"00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,921"
"The previous tenant, Mrs. Gardenia,"

28
"00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,965"
"passed away just a few days ago,"

29
"00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,800"
So nothing has been moved yet.

30
"00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,010"
Her son asked me to say that
some of the furniture

31
"00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,221"
could be picked up practically
for the asking.

32
"00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,098"
Did she die in the apartment?

33
"00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,349"
Not that it makes any difference.

34
"00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,309"
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
In a hospital.

35
"00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,603"
She'd been in a coma for weeks.

36
"00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,813"
"After you, please."

37
"00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,106"
Thank you.

38
"00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,067"
She was very old

39
"00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,528"
and passed away without ever waking.

40
"00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,697"
I'd be grateful to go that way
myself when the time comes.

41
"00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,243"
"Oh, no, no, no, not"
"in the apartment, no."

42
"00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,372"
"She was chipper right to the end,"

43
"00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,458"
been one of the first women
lawyers in New York state.

44
"00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,334"
Did a little gardening on
"the side, too."

45
"00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,878"
She was quite a woman.

46
"00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,171"
"Oh, closet."

47
"00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,423"
"Oh, plenty of closets."

48
"00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,218"
"Oh, nice view of the park."

49
"00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,344"
"Oh, very nice view."

50
"00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,971"
Yeah.

51
"00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,139"
"Now, this room, for instance,"

52
"00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,224"
it would make a lovely nursery.

53
"00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,976"
Yes. Yellow and white wallpaper

54
"00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,895"
would brighten it tremendously.

55
"00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,521"
What are all these things here?

56
"00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,356"
"Herbs, mostly."

57
"00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,733"
A nice large bathroom.

58
"00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,693"
"Mmm. Mint, basil."

59
"00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,487"
Yeah.
No marijuana?

60
"00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,156"
Come on.

61
"00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,830"
"The, uh, master bedroom."

62
"00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,457"
"Oh, yes."

63
"00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,833"
"Here we are, back at the hallway again."

64
"00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,336"
There.

65
"00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,005"
Oh.

66
"00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,131"
"Oh, Guy!"

67
"00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,424"
Yeah.

68
"00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,592"
Ohh!

69
"00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,635"
"The fireplace works,"
of course.

70
"00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,719"
Great.

71
"00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,805"
Ohl

72
"00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,933"
"Oh, it's a wonderful apartment."
I love it!

73
"00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,476"
See what she's trying to do?

74
"00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,144"
She's trying to get you
"to lower the rent, see?"

75
"00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,438"
Yes.
"Well, we'd raise it if we were allowed."

76
"00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,190"
Apartments with this kind of charm--

77
"00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,403"
"Why, that's odd."

78
"00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,244"
There's a closet behind that secretary.

79
"00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,247"
I'm su--
I'm sure there is.

80
"00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,915"
"Yeah. Oh, I think you're right."

81
"00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,921"
She moved it.
It used to be there.

82
"00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,263"
"Ohh! Give me a hand, will you?"

83
"00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,872"
I see now why she went into a coma.

84
"00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,124"
"Ha, ha, hal"

85
"00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,542"
She couldn't have lifted it by herself.

86
"00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,043"
She was 89.

87
"00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,420"
Should we open it?

88
"00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,921"
Maybe her son should.

89
"00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,384"
I'm authorized to show the apartment.

90
"00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,262"
Well!

91
"00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,972"
Whatever she locked in
got out.

92
"00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,183"
"Well, perhaps she didn't"
need five closets.

93
"00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,728"
Why would she cover up her vacuum
cleaner and her towels?

94
"00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,481"
I don't suppose we'll ever know.

95
"00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,775"
Maybe she was becoming senile after all.

96
"00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,277"
Is there anything else?

97
"00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,070"
"Yes, please. What about"
the laundry facilities?

98
"00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,906"
It's bigger than the other one.

99
"00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,782"
"Yeah. It's more expensive,"
"too, you know?"

100
"00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,161"
It's better located.

101
"00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,787"
"Yeah, well, God knows,"

102
"00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,372"
I could walk to all the
theaters from here.

103
"00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,458"
"Oh, Guy, let's take it, please?"

104
"00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,001"
That living room could be--

105
"00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,669"
"Oh, please, let's take it."

106
"00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,255"
"Okay, darling, we get out"
"of the other lease, okay."

107
"00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,882"
I was tempted to write the management

108
"00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,009"
that you were drug addicts
and litterbugs.

109
"00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,345"
"Instead, I decided to lie"

110
"00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,888"
and tell them you were
wonderful tenants.

111
"00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,182"
"Oh, you're great, Hutch."

112
"00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,600"
"Wish I could talk you out of it, though."

113
"00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,101"
"He's pulling your leg, Ro honey."

114
"00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,686"
Indeed I'm not.

115
"00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,521"
"Now, that looks great."
That is--

116
"00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,106"
Are you aware that the Bramford

117
"00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,693"
had rather an unpleasant reputation
around the turn of the century?

118
"00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,862"
It's where the Trench sisters

119
"00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,531"
conducted their little
dietary experiments

120
"00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,867"
and Keith Kennedy held his parties.

121
"00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,286"
"Adrian Marcato lived there, too."
So did Pearl Ames.

122
"00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,371"
Who were the Trench sisters?

123
"00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,705"
Who was Adrian Marcato?

124
"00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,833"
The Trench sisters were two
proper Victorian ladies.

125
"00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,045"
They cooked and ate several young
"children, including a niece."

126
"00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,546"
"Oh, lovely."

127
"00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,216"
Adrian Marcato practiced witchcraft.

128
"00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,051"
He made quite a splash in the nineties

129
"00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,720"
by announcing that he'd conjured
up the living devil.

130
"00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,597"
"Apparently, people believed him,"

131
"00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,391"
so they attacked and nearly killed him

132
"00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,892"
in the lobby of the Bramford.

133
"00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,477"
You're joking.

134
"00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,562"
"Later, the Keith Kennedy business began,"

135
"00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,065"
"and by the twenties, the"
house was half empty.

136
"00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,566"
I knew about Keith Kennedy.

137
"00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,151"
I didn't know that Marcato
lived there.

138
"00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,486"
And those sisters.

139
"00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,071"
World War ll filled the house up again.

140
"00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,407"
Terrific.

141
"00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,866"
What? The house?

142
"00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,118"
The lamb.
Oh.

143
"00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,620"
They called it Black Bramford.

144
"00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,249"
"But, Hutch, awful things happen"
in every apartment house.

145
"00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,626"
"Ah, but this house has a high incidence"
of unpleasant happenings.

146
"00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:25,338"
"In '59, a dead infant was found,"

147
"00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,590"
wrapped in newspaper in the basement.

148
"00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,926"
Mmm! You really rouse my appetite.

149
"00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,429"
Have some more wine.

150
"00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,384"
Roman!

151
"00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,553"
Bring me in some root beer
when you come!

152
"00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,924"
"Hey, these are shelves."

153
"00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,689"
Hey...

154
"00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,525"
let's make love.

155
"00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,110"
Shh!

156
"00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,281"
I think I hear the Trench
sisters chewing.

157
"00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,616"
Ohl

158
"00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,630"
Straight up to the left.

159
"00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,382"
"Here in Daytona, Florida,"

160
"00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,801"
it's the 250-cc 100-mile classic

161
"00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,679"
with Yamaha leading the
pack on the final lap...

162
"00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,974"
"and winning it, as Yamaha takes"
7 of the top 10 places.

163
"00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,685"
It's the third straight year
"for Yamaha, a clean sweep."

164
"00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,772"
"Yamaha is race bred from champions,"

165
"00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,065"
"and, as you can see,"

166
"00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,567"
we have a model for
every kind of riding.

167
"00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,403"
"You know, you really should discover"
the swingin' world of Yamaha.

168
"00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,488"
"Why don't you get on, have a ride?"

169
"00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,948"
Come on. Get on.

170
"00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,324"
"Okay, come on."
Let's go.

171
"00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,331"
Look.

172
"00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,130"
It's great.

173
"00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,275"
I'm sorry. I thought you were
"Victoria Vetri, the actress."

174
"00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,694"
I'm sorry.

175
"00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,028"
That's all right.

176
"00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,697"
A lot of people think I'm Victoria.

177
"00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,323"
I don't see any resemblance.

178
"00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,408"
Do you know her?

179
"00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,659"
No.

180
"00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,163"
My name's Terry Gionoffrio.

181
"00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,541"
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

182
"00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,043"
"Uh, we-- We're new tenants here."

183
"00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,462"
"I'm staying with the Castevets,"
seventh floor.

184
"00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,715"
"I'm their guest, sort of, since June."

185
"00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,717"
Our apartment used to be
the back part of yours.

186
"00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,093"
"Oh, for goodness sakes."

187
"00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,720"
You took the old lady's
"apartment. Mrs., uh--"

188
"00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,264"
"Yeah, um, Miss, uh..."
Gard-- Gardenia.

189
"00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,058"
Gardenia. Yeah.
She was a good friend of the Castevets.

190
"00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,727"
She used to grow all kinds of herbs
and things for her to cook with.

191
"00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,854"
I saw those plants.

192
"00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,813"
"Yeah. Well, now, she"
grows her own things.

193
"00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,232"
Excuse me a moment.
I have to put the softener in.

194
"00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,403"
What does your husband do?
He's an actor.

195
"00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,696"
No kidding?
What's his name?

196
"00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,072"
Guy Woodhouse.

197
"00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,743"
He was in Luther and Nobody
"Loves an Albatross,"

198
"00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,077"
and he does a lot of
television and radio.

199
"00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,247"
"Gee, I watch TV all day long."

200
"00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,457"
I'll bet I've seen him.

201
"00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,752"
Wow!
Ooh!

202
"00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,254"
I hate this basement.

203
"00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,547"
"Yeah, me, too."

204
"00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,090"
It gives me the creeps.

205
"00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,717"
"Listen, why don't we come"
down here together regular

206
"00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,968"
and do our laundry?

207
"00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,928"
"Okay, that would be great."

208
"00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,513"
I have a good luck charm.

209
"00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,723"
It might work for both of us.

210
"00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,560"
"Oh, that's beautiful."

211
"00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,604"
Isn't it?
Mmm-hmm!

212
"00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,647"
Mrs. Castevet gave it to me.
It's good luck.

213
"00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,066"
"Anyway, it's supposed to be."

214
"00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,025"
It's got some stuff inside.

215
"00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,697"
"Ha, ha, hal"

216
"00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,282"
I'm not mad about the smell either.

217
"00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,575"
I hope it works.

218
"00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,826"
"It's a beautiful charm, though."

219
"00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,620"
I've never seen anything like it.

220
"00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,622"
European.

221
"00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,833"
The Castevets are the most wonderful
"people in the world, bar none."

222
"00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,502"
"You know, they picked me up"
"off the sidewalk, literally?"

223
"00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,461"
You were sick?

224
"00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,963"
I was starving and on dope

225
"00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,632"
and doing a lot of other things.

226
"00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,883"
"They're childless, though."

227
"00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,802"
I'm like the daughter they never had.

228
"00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,221"
"At first, I thought they wanted"
"me for some kind of sex thing,"

229
"00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,889"
but they've turned out to
be like real grandparents.

230
"00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,226"
It's nice to know there
are people like that

231
"00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,770"
when you hear so much about apathy

232
"00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,314"
and people who are afraid
of getting involved.

233
"00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,066"
I'd be dead now if it wasn't for them.

234
"00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,693"
"That's an absolute fact,"
dead or in jail.

235
"00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,779"
You don't have any family
that could have helped you?

236
"00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,323"
A brother in the navy.

237
"00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:11,536"
"Why, it's impossible to be 100% sure!"

238
"00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,664"
"If you want my opinion, we"
shouldn't tell her at all!

239
"00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,957"
That's my opinion!

240
"00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,167"
That must be the partition.

241
"00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,171"
That's the back part of the original
"10 with a dining room,"

242
"00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,090"
and there's--
"there's a closet over here,"

243
"00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,341"
and then there's a closet over here.

244
"00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,174"
"Stay back, huh, lady?"

245
"00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,975"
"Get back now, will you, please?"

246
"00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,310"
Get back. There's nothing to see.

247
"00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,228"
"Get back, will you, please?"

248
"00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:22,982"
Jesus.

249
"00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,193"
Get back!

250
"00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,527"
We know her.

251
"00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,528"
What's her name?

252
"00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,447"
Terry.

253
"00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,406"
Terry what?

254
"00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,533"
Ro?

255
"00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,576"
What was her name again?

256
"00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,827"
Terry what?

257
"00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,162"
uh...

258
"00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,414"
I don't remember.
An Italian name.

259
"00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,082"
She was staying with some
"people named Castevet,"

260
"00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,209"
7-E.

261
"00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,919"
Yeah. We got that already.

262
"00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,755"
Short and sweet.

263
"00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,840"
She stuck it to the windowsill
with a Band-Aid. Come on.

264
"00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,841"
Get back.

265
"00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,468"
Theresa Gionoffrio.

266
"00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,802"
Move on!

267
"00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,262"
Move on!

268
"00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,973"
You knew her?

269
"00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,683"
Only slightly.

270
"00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,060"
"Come on, Ro baby."
Let's go.

271
"00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,478"
Oh! Here they come.

272
"00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,192"
You folks the Castevets
on the seventh floor?

273
"00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,443"
We are.

274
"00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,486"
You have a young woman

275
"00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,863"
named Theresa Gionoffrio
living with you?

276
"00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,949"
We do. What's wrong?
Has there been an accident?

277
"00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,408"
You'd better brace yourself

278
"00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,618"
for some bad news.

279
"00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,661"
She's dead.

280
"00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,080"
Jumped out of the window.

281
"00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,582"
That's not possible!
That's a mistake!

282
"00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,293"
"Artie, you want to let these"
"folks take a look, please?"

283
"00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,631"
I knew this would happen.

284
"00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:32,301"
She got deeply depressed
every three weeks or so.

285
"00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,428"
"I told my wife about it,"
but she pooh-poohed me.

286
"00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,975"
"Well, that-- that doesn't"
mean she killed herself.

287
"00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,726"
She was a very happy girl

288
"00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,478"
with no reason for self-destruction.

289
"00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,189"
She must have been cleaning
the windows or something.

290
"00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,941"
She wasn't cleaning windows at midnight.

291
"00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,818"
Why not? Maybe she was!

292
"00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,944"
Is that her handwriting?

293
"00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,864"
Yeah.

294
"00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,283"
Definitely.
Absolutely.

295
"00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,659"
Thank you.

296
"00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,911"
I'll see this gets back to
you when we're done with it.

297
"00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,037"
I don't believe it.

298
"00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,330"
I just don't believe it.

299
"00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,832"
She was so happy.

300
"00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,292"
Who's the next of kin?

301
"00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,210"
She's all alone.
"She didn't have anybody,"

302
"00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,587"
only us.

303
"00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,172"
Didn't she have a brother?
Did she?

304
"00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,717"
She said she did.
In the navy.

305
"00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,176"
News to me.

306
"00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,636"
Do you know where he's stationed?

307
"00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,972"
"No, I don't."

308
"00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,600"
She mentioned him to me
in the laundry room.

309
"00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,851"
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

310
"00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,270"
"Uh, we're in, uh, 7-E."

311
"00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,439"
I feel just the way you
"do, Mrs. Castevet."

312
"00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,525"
She seemed so happy and full of--

313
"00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,194"
She said wonderful things
"about you and your husband,"

314
"00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,696"
how grateful she was.

315
"00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,239"
Thank you.

316
"00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,574"
You know anything else
about this brother

317
"00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,783"
except he's in the navy?

318
"00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,035"
"No, I don't."

319
"00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,244"
It should be easy
to find him.

320
"00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,288"
Okay.

321
"00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,040"
I'm so stunned.
I'm so sorry.

322
"00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,416"
It's such a pity.

323
"00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,375"
"Well, thank you."

324
"00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,461"
Sometimes I wonder how come you're
the leader of anything.

325
"00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,763"
Please don't tell me
what Laura-Louise said

326
"00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,807"
because I'm not interested.

327
"00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,974"
"If you'd listened to me,"

328
"00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,268"
we wouldn't have had to do this!

329
"00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,104"
We'd have been all set to go now

330
"00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,523"
instead of having to start
all over from scratch!

331
"00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,483"
I told you not to tell her in advance!

332
"00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,735"
I told you she wouldn't be open-minded!

333
"00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,366"
I told Sister Veronica
"about the windows,"

334
"00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,284"
and she withdrew the school
from the competition.

335
"00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,619"
"Otherwise, we would--"

336
"00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,379"
Hello. How are you?

337
"00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,839"
Fine. May I come in a minute?

338
"00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,257"
"Yes, of course. Please do."

339
"00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,675"
I just come over to thank you

340
"00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,385"
for saying those nice things
to us the other night.

341
"00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,970"
"Oh, no, please."
There's--

342
"00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,846"
Poor Terry.

343
"00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,556"
We thought maybe we'd
"failed her some way,"

344
"00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,599"
although her note made it
crystal clear we hadn't.

345
"00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,560"
You'll never know how helpful it was

346
"00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,103"
in such a shock moment.

347
"00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,479"
So I do thank you.
"Roman does, too."

348
"00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,773"
Roman's my hubby.

349
"00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:33,983"
You're welcome.

350
"00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,276"
I'm glad I could help.

351
"00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,195"
"Yeah. Well, she was cremated yesterday."

352
"00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,947"
Now we got to forget and go on.

353
"00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,158"
It won't be easy.
We don't have any children of our own.

354
"00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,409"
You have any?
"No, we don't."

355
"00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,785"
"Oh, well, there you have it."

356
"00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,912"
"Ohh! Oh,"

357
"00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,748"
that's a nice--

358
"00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,207"
Look how you put the table!

359
"00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,709"
"Now, isn't that interesting?"

360
"00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,002"
I saw it in a magazine.

361
"00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,629"
"Oh, my. Nice paint job."

362
"00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,839"
I know.

363
"00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,424"
Ahh... well.

364
"00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,675"
That's nice.
What is that?

365
"00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,010"
That's the TV room?

366
"00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,803"
"Yeah, well, only temporarily."

367
"00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,096"
It's going to be a nursery.

368
"00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,181"
"Oh, you're pregnant?"

369
"00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,599"
"No, not yet."

370
"00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,350"
I hope to be as soon as we're settled.

371
"00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,269"
"Wonderful. Well, you're"
young and healthy.

372
"00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,771"
You ought to have lots of children.

373
"00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,522"
We plan to have three.

374
"00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,399"
I'm dying to see what you
did to this apartment.

375
"00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,318"
The woman who had it before
was a dear friend of mine.

376
"00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,652"
I know.
Terry told me.

377
"00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,029"
"Oh, did she?"

378
"00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,031"
You two had some long talks
together in the laundry room.

379
"00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,240"
Only one.

380
"00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,534"
"Oh! Oh, my goodness!"

381
"00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,370"
"Ah, ha, ha! It looks so much brighter."

382
"00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,498"
What do you pay for a chair like that?

383
"00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,832"
"Uh, oh..."

384
"00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,167"
"um, I'm not sure, really."

385
"00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,543"
I think about $200.

386
"00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,711"
Hmm.

387
"00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,589"
What does your hubby do?

388
"00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,216"
He's an actor.

389
"00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,885"
I knew it! I said it to Roman yesterday.

390
"00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,054"
He's so good-looking.

391
"00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,680"
What movies was he in?

392
"00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,140"
No movies.

393
"00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,892"
He was in two plays called Luther

394
"00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,519"
and Nobody Loves an Albatross

395
"00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,771"
and a lot of television and radio.

396
"00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,189"
"Listen, Rosemary..."

397
"00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,066"
I got a 2-inch thick sirloin steak

398
"00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,651"
sitting defrosting right this minute.

399
"00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,069"
"Why don't you and Guy come over,"

400
"00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,111"
have supper with us tonight?

401
"00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,363"
What do you say?

402
"00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,531"
"Oh, no. We couldn't."

403
"00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,824"
Why not?

404
"00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,076"
"No, really, that's very kind of you."
Listen--

405
"00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,328"
It would be a real help to us. Oh--

406
"00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,456"
First night we'll be alone since--

407
"00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,959"
"Oh, are you sure it wouldn't"
be too much trouble for you?

408
"00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,335"
"Oh, honey, if it was trouble,"

409
"00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,795"
I wouldn't ask you.

410
"00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,922"
All right.
You go ahead and count on us.

411
"00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,507"
"I'll have to check with Guy,"
though.

412
"00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,760"
"Listen, you tell him I won't"
take no for an answer!

413
"00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,220"
Oh! Here's your mail!

414
"00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,596"
Oh! Ads!

415
"00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:28,806"
Thank you.

416
"00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,775"
Yoo-hoo!

417
"00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,360"
Hey.

418
"00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,612"
Mmm!

419
"00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,877"
Donald Baumgart got that part.

420
"00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,474"
It's a bad play anyway.

421
"00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,184"
"Yeah. Even if it folds out of town,"

422
"00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,477"
it's the kind of part that gets noticed.

423
"00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,403"
Mrs. Castevet was here

424
"00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,406"
to thank me for what I said about Terry.

425
"00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,660"
She is the nosiest person
I've ever seen.

426
"00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,163"
You know she actually asked
the prices of things?

427
"00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,497"
No kidding.

428
"00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,919"
She invited us to have dinner
with them tonight.

429
"00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,629"
"I told her I'd have to check with you,"

430
"00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,422"
but that it would probably be okay.

431
"00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,341"
"Oh, Jesus! We don't have"
"to do that, do we, honey?"

432
"00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,344"
I think they're lonely.

433
"00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,304"
We get friendly with an
"old couple like that,"

434
"00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,430"
and we'll never get rid of them.

435
"00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:52,640"
They're right across the wall.

436
"00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,017"
I told her she could count on us.

437
"00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,189"
You don't have to sulk about it.

438
"00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,440"
I'm not sulking.

439
"00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,524"
I see exactly what you mean.

440
"00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,860"
"Hell, we'll go."

441
"00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,362"
"No, no. What for?"

442
"00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,738"
We'll go!

443
"00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,908"
No. We don't have to
if you don't want to.

444
"00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,535"
"That sounds so phony, but I"
"really mean it, really, I do."

445
"00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,664"
Be my good deed for the day.

446
"00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,502"
"Okay, but only if you want to."

447
"00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,712"
We'll make it clear that it's
just for this one night

448
"00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,507"
and not the beginning
"of anything, right?"

449
"00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,218"
Oh! Perfect timing!
Come oniin.

450
"00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,637"
Roman's fixing us some vodka blushes.

451
"00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,889"
"My, I'm glad you could come, Guy."

452
"00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,600"
I'm fixing to tell everybody
that I knew you when.

453
"00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,102"
"Look, dinner isn't ready just yet,"

454
"00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,561"
but sit down there anywhere.

455
"00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,230"
Take a seat on the couch.

456
"00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,439"
You'll find yourself very comfortable.

457
"00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,025"
I seem to have overfilled the glasses.

458
"00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,902"
"No, no, no."
Don't get up.

459
"00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:50,030"
"Generally, I pour these out precisely"
"as a bartender, don't I, Minnie?"

460
"00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,573"
Just watch the carpet.

461
"00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,534"
But this evening I made
"a little too much,"

462
"00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,244"
and rather I'm afr--
"Oh, there we are."

463
"00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,204"
"No, no, no."
"Sit down, please."

464
"00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,872"
"Now, Mrs. Woodhouse--"
Thank you.

465
"00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,416"
"Uh, Mr. Woodhouse,"

466
"00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,626"
"uh, vodka blush?"
"Yes, thanks."

467
"00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,169"
Have you ever tasted one?

468
"00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,421"
"No, no."
I haven't.

469
"00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,714"
It looks delicious.

470
"00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,425"
Minnie. They're very
popular in Australia.

471
"00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,802"
"Now, to our guests--"
Welcome to our home.

472
"00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:12,928"
"Hear, hear."

473
"00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,013"
Cheers.

474
"00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:14,972"
Mmm.

475
"00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,852"
The carpet.

476
"00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,228"
"Oh, dear."

477
"00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,688"
Brand-new carpet.

478
"00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,399"
This man is so clumsy!

479
"00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,444"
Do you come from Australia?

480
"00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,196"
"Oh, no, no. I'm from right"
here in New York City.

481
"00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,781"
"I've been there, though."

482
"00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,242"
"I've been everywhere, literally."

483
"00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,411"
"You name a place, and I've been there."

484
"00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,246"
Go ahead. Name a place.

485
"00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,456"
"Fairbanks, Alaska!"

486
"00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,125"
"I've been there, been all over Alaska--"

487
"00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:47,504"
"Yes-- Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage,"
"Nome, Sitka, Seward."

488
"00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,298"
I spent four months there in '38--

489
"00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,424"
Where are you folks from?

490
"00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,550"
Well--
"Well, I--"

491
"00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,636"
I'm from Omaha.
Guy's from Baltimore.

492
"00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,971"
Omaha's a good city.

493
"00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,638"
"Baltimore is, too."

494
"00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,141"
Do you travel for business?

495
"00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,101"
"Well, business and pleasure both."

496
"00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,688"
"I'm 79, and I've been going one"
place or another since I was 10.

497
"00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,315"
"You name a place, I've been there."

498
"00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,649"
Ah! Steak's ready.

499
"00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,776"
"Don't rush your drinks, now."

500
"00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:10,986"
"Roman, take your pill!"

501
"00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,156"
No pope ever visits a city

502
"00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,949"
where the newspapers are on strike.

503
"00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,659"
I heard he's going to postpone

504
"00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,078"
and wait till it's over.

505
"00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:19,995"
"Well, that's show biz."

506
"00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,916"
That's exactly what it is.

507
"00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,293"
"All the costumes are rituals,"

508
"00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,878"
all religions.

509
"00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,797"
"Oh, I think we're offending Rosemary."

510
"00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,048"
"No, no."

511
"00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,966"
"No, you're not religious,"
"my dear, are you?"

512
"00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,010"
"Well, I was brought up a Catholic."

513
"00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,512"
Now I don't know.

514
"00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,138"
You looked uncomfortable.

515
"00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,765"
"Well, he is the pope."

516
"00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,975"
"Now, you don't need to"
have respect for him

517
"00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,936"
because he pretends that he's holy.

518
"00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,270"
"Now, that's a good point."

519
"00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,899"
When I think what they spend
on robes and jewels!

520
"00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:52,694"
A good picture of the hypocrisy
behind organized religion

521
"00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,863"
"was given, I thought, in Luther."

522
"00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,865"
Did you ever get to play
"that leading part, Guy?"

523
"00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:57,866"
Me? No.

524
"00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,786"
Weren't you Albert Finney's understudy?

525
"00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,246"
No.

526
"00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,539"
"Well, that's strange."

527
"00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,332"
I remember being struck
by a gesture you made

528
"00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,375"
and checking in the program

529
"00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,501"
to see who you were.

530
"00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,752"
Thank you.

531
"00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,712"
"Um, what gesture was that?"

532
"00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,882"
"Well, I'm not sure now."
It was a reaction--

533
"00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,884"
"Oh, I did a thing with my arms"

534
"00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,511"
when Luther was having a fit.

535
"00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,972"
It was a kind of involuntary reach.

536
"00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,517"
That's it! That's it.
It had a wonderful authenticity to it.

537
"00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,643"
"Oh, come on."

538
"00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,603"
"No, no."
I mean it.

539
"00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,897"
"My father was a theatrical producer,"

540
"00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,025"
and my early years were
spent in the company

541
"00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,695"
"of Mrs. Fiske, Forbes-Robertson,"
Modjeska.

542
"00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,779"
Guy?

543
"00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,573"
"Oh, yes, please."

544
"00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,826"
You have a most interesting
"inner quality, Guy."

545
"00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,495"
"It appears in your television work, too."

546
"00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,247"
"It should take you a long way, indeed,"

547
"00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:48,125"
"provided, of course, that you"
get those initial breaks.

548
"00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,752"
Are you preparing for a show now?

549
"00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,756"
"Um, well, I'm up for a couple parts."

550
"00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,967"
"Well, I can't believe that"
you won't get them.

551
"00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,635"
"Well, I can."

552
"00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,762"
I'd like to have a spice garden someday.

553
"00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,891"
I guess I'm a country girl at heart.

554
"00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,350"
You come from a big family?

555
"00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,602"
Mm-hmm.

556
"00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,061"
Three brothers and two sisters.

557
"00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,104"
Your sisters married?

558
"00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,355"
Mm-hmm.

559
"00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,773"
They have children?

560
"00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,067"
"One has two, the other has four."

561
"00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,486"
There's a chance you'll have
"lots of children, too."

562
"00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,572"
"We're fertile, all right."

563
"00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,699"
I've got 16 nieces and nephews.

564
"00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,618"
"Oh, my goodness!"

565
"00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,459"
"Would you like me to wash, and"
you can wipe for a while?

566
"00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,044"
"Oh, no."
"That's fine, dear."

567
"00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,639"
"Now, Roman, will you stop"
bending Guy's ears

568
"00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,474"
with your Modjeska stories?

569
"00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,309"
He's only listening 'cause he's polite.

570
"00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,852"
"No, no, no, no."
"It's very interesting, Mrs. Castevet."

571
"00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,229"
Minnie!

572
"00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,897"
I'm Minnie.
"He's Roman, okay?"

573
"00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,398"
Okay?

574
"00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,524"
Okay.

575
"00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,817"
Okay!

576
"00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,236"
Terrific.
Just terrific.

577
"00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,320"
"Good-bye, darling."
Good-bye.

578
"00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,571"
Thank you for having us.

579
"00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:00,989"
"Yeah, it was lovely."
"Oh, bless you."

580
"00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,282"
Minnie!

581
"00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,201"
"Minnie, ya good kid, ya."

582
"00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,578"
Ooh!
"About that steak, huh?"

583
"00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,497"
"Oh, my God!"
And the cake.

584
"00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,957"
How did you eat two pieces?

585
"00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,291"
It was weird.

586
"00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,001"
Out of politeness.
That's how I ate two pieces.

587
"00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,086"
Out of politeness.

588
"00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,963"
"Ha, ha, hal"

589
"00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,881"
Only three dinner plates that matched.

590
"00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,883"
Shh!

591
"00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,970"
"And all that beautiful,"
beautiful silver.

592
"00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,012"
We'll be nice.
Maybe they'll will it to us.

593
"00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,180"
Ohl

594
"00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,932"
Yeah.

595
"00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,475"
Guess what they have in their bathroom.

596
"00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,143"
A bidet.

597
"00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,061"
Jokes for the John.

598
"00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,604"
No.

599
"00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,189"
A book on a hook right
next to the toilet.

600
"00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,859"
Roman's stories are pretty
"damned interesting, though."

601
"00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,986"
Yeah?

602
"00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,656"
Never even heard of Forbes-Robertson
before.

603
"00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,284"
I'm going to go over there again
tomorrow night and hear some more.

604
"00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,244"
You are?
Yeah. He asked me.

605
"00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,371"
Here. Do this damn thing
"for me, will you?"

606
"00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,290"
I thought we were going to do something
with Joan and Dick Jellico.

607
"00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,542"
Was that definite?
"Well, it wasn't definite."

608
"00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:54,793"
We'll see them next week.

609
"00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,214"
You don't have to come along
if you don't want to.

610
"00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,674"
You can stay here.

611
"00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,927"
"Yeah, I think I will stay here."

612
"00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,805"
"He knew Henry Irving, too."

613
"00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,099"
"I mean, really interesting, you know?"

614
"00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,059"
Why did they take their pictures down?

615
"00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,603"
What do you mean?

616
"00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,564"
Their pictures.
They took them down.

617
"00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,317"
The hooks in the wall and clean spaces

618
"00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,277"
and the one picture that
is there doesn't fit.

619
"00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,154"
I didn't notice that.

620
"00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,819"
"Hi, dear. We're not bothering"
"you, are we?"

621
"00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,446"
This is my dear friend
"Laura-Louise McBurney,"

622
"00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,781"
lives up on 12.

623
"00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,075"
"Laura-Louise, this is"
"Guy's wife, Rosemary."

624
"00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,327"
"Hello, Rosemary."
Welcome to the Bram!

625
"00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,746"
Laura-Louise just met Guy.
"She wanted to meet you, too."

626
"00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:13,997"
Could we come in?

627
"00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,083"
"Uh, of course."
Please do.

628
"00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,542"
There you are.
Go ahead.

629
"00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,627"
"Oh, look what you got."

630
"00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,836"
There's a light.

631
"00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,798"
"Oh, gosh!"

632
"00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,716"
Isn't that beautiful!

633
"00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,593"
It came this morning.

634
"00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,303"
"Are you all right, dear?"
You look worn.

635
"00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,596"
"Oh, no. I'm fine."

636
"00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,139"
It's the first day of my period.

637
"00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,724"
And you're up and around?

638
"00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,227"
"On my first day, I experienced"
"such pain,"

639
"00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,979"
"I couldn't move, eat, or anything."

640
"00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,149"
Dan used to give me gin through
a straw to kill the pain.

641
"00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,944"
Girls today take things much
more in their stride.

642
"00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,529"
"They're much healthier than we were,"

643
"00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,281"
"Thanks to vitamins, better medical care."

644
"00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,492"
What are those things over
"there, seat covers?"

645
"00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,411"
"Um, cushions for the window seats."

646
"00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,787"
"Oh, yeah."

647
"00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,877"
"Oh, before I forget."

648
"00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,339"
This is for you from Roman and me.

649
"00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,341"
For me?

650
"00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,635"
It's just a little present
is all. For moving in.

651
"00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:09,970"
There's no reason--

652
"00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,847"
It's real old.
It's over 300 years.

653
"00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,940"
It's lovely.

654
"00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:24,443"
Yeah. The green inside
is called tannis root.

655
"00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,819"
That's for good luck.

656
"00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,364"
"It's lovely, but I--"
I can't accept it.

657
"00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,449"
You already have.

658
"00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,533"
Put it on.

659
"00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,826"
Yeah.

660
"00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:38,290"
"Ah, you'll get used to the"
smell before you know it.

661
"00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,541"
"Yeah, go on."

662
"00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,087"
"Ohh, yes."

663
"00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,258"
Were his stories as interesting
as last night?

664
"00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,385"
Yes. Did you have a good time?

665
"00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,636"
All right.

666
"00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,888"
I got a present.

667
"00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,808"
It was Terry's.

668
"00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,059"
No kidding?

669
"00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,227"
"Kind of pretty, though."

670
"00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:04,900"
Aren't you going to wear it?

671
"00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,318"
Mm-mmm.
It smells.

672
"00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,945"
There's stuff in it called tannis root

673
"00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,822"
from her greenhouse.

674
"00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,407"
"Not too bad, though."

675
"00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,617"
"Ha, ha, ha."

676
"00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,502"
"Tannis, anyone?"

677
"00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,003"
"Well, if you took it,"

678
"00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,213"
you ought to wear it.

679
"00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:45,815"
Hello.

680
"00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,234"
Yes.

681
"00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,151"
This is he.

682
"00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,952"
"Oh, God, no."

683
"00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,539"
"Oh, the poor guy."

684
"00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,251"
"And, uh..."

685
"00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,711"
they don't have any idea
what's causing it?

686
"00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,296"
"Oh, my God."
That's awful.

687
"00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,381"
That's just awful.

688
"00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,926"
"Yes, I would."

689
"00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,136"
"I mean, yes, I am."

690
"00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,182"
"I hate to get it that way, but--"

691
"00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,728"
"Well, you'd have to speak to my agent"

692
"00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,646"
about that end of it.

693
"00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,025"
Alan Stone.

694
"00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,652"
I'm sure there won't be
"any problem, Mr. Weiss,"

695
"00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:31,987"
not as far as we're concerned.

696
"00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,323"
"Thank you, Mr. Weiss."

697
"00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,329"
Guy?

698
"00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,999"
What is it?

699
"00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,672"
Donald Baumgart--
He's gone blind.

700
"00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,009"
"He woke up yesterday, and he can't see."

701
"00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,553"
"Oh, no."

702
"00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,554"
"Oh, I've got the part."

703
"00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,640"
It's a hell of a way to get it.

704
"00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,690"
"Listen, uh,"

705
"00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,025"
I have to get out and walk around.

706
"00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,443"
I understand.
Go ahead.

707
"00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,124"
Baumgart--
Donald Baumgart.

708
"00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,294"
It's a fascinating part.

709
"00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,212"
He'll really be noticed this time.

710
"00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,881"
He also has an offer for a lead

711
"00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,258"
"in a television series, Miami"
Beach.

712
"00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,385"
He's suddenly very hot.

713
"00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,930"
Mm-hmm. I understand why
you're so overjoyed.

714
"00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,517"
"Well, it's a difficult"
period in his life.

715
"00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,477"
A challenge.

716
"00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,979"
I see.

717
"00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,230"
You know how actors are.

718
"00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,399"
They're all a bit self-centered.

719
"00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,068"
I'll bet even Laurence Olivier

720
"00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,694"
is vain and self-centered.

721
"00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,740"
It's a difficult part.

722
"00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,200"
"He's got to work with crutches,"

723
"00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,078"
"and, naturally, he's preoccupied."

724
"00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,080"
And he--

725
"00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,290"
"Well, preoccupied."

726
"00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,587"
I see you had another suicide
up there at happy house.

727
"00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,381"
"Oh, didn't I tell you?"

728
"00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,423"
"No, you didn't."

729
"00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,509"
"It was that girl I told you about,"

730
"00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,637"
the drug-addict who was rehabilitated
"by this old couple, the Castevets."

731
"00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,263"
I'm sure I told you that.

732
"00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,183"
They didn't rehabilitate her
"very successfully, it seems."

733
"00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,331"
I've been a creep.

734
"00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,626"
It's from worrying if Baumgart
"would regain his sight,"

735
"00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,752"
rat that I am.

736
"00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,003"
"Oh, it's natural."

737
"00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,630"
You're bound to feel two ways about it.

738
"00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,882"
Even if I'm Mr. Yamaha
"for the rest of my days,"

739
"00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,467"
I'm going to stop giving you
the short end of the stick.

740
"00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,552"
You haven't been.

741
"00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,053"
"Yes, I have."

742
"00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,305"
I've been tearing my hair
out over my career.

743
"00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,142"
Let's have a baby.
All right?

744
"00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,310"
"Let's have three babies,"
"one at a time, all right?"

745
"00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,479"
A baby. You know.

746
"00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,565"
"Mama, Dada, poo-poo."
You know?

747
"00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,774"
You mean it?

748
"00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:15,942"
"Sure, I mean it."

749
"00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,902"
"I mean, I even figured out"
"the right time to start,"

750
"00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,154"
look.

751
"00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,490"
"You mean it, really?"

752
"00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,701"
"No, I'm kidding."
"Sure, I mean it."

753
"00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,955"
"Oh, Ro, honey, for God's"
"sake, don't cry."

754
"00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,415"
I won't. I won't.

755
"00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,416"
"Ha, ha, ha."

756
"00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,464"
Here goes nothing.

757
"00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,894"
The paint!

758
"00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,520"
The paint!

759
"00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:53,563"
Good grief.

760
"00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,575"
"Nobody, but nobody has a fire tonight."

761
"00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,958"
Isn't it gorgeous?

762
"00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,752"
I hope we have the coldest winter ever.

763
"00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,394"
"Oh, shit!"

764
"00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,403"
"Hi, Guy!"

765
"00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,196"
How are ya?

766
"00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,031"
"No, don't let her in."

767
"00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,783"
Not tonight.

768
"00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:47,784"
"Oh, that's very kind of you."

769
"00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,873"
"Oh, are you sure"

770
"00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,499"
you don't want to come in?

771
"00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,501"
No! I don't want to bother you.

772
"00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,630"
Good.

773
"00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,384"
Good.

774
"00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,594"
Who says there's nothing to E.S.P.?

775
"00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,430"
Madame and monsieur shall have
ze dessert after all!

776
"00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,849"
Mousse au chocolat.

777
"00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,309"
Or as Minnie calls it--
chocolate mouse.

778
"00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,938"
I was afraid she'd stay all evening.

779
"00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,065"
She just wanted us to try it.

780
"00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,568"
Seein' it's one of her specialities.

781
"00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,152"
"It was sweet of her, really."

782
"00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,654"
We shouldn't make fun of her.

783
"00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,655"
"Yeah, you're right, you're"
"right, you're right."

784
"00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,545"
Mmm! It's good.

785
"00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,645"
Has an undertaste.

786
"00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,982"
A chalky undertaste.

787
"00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,569"
I don't get it.

788
"00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,405"
"That's silly, honey."

789
"00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,073"
There is no undertaste.

790
"00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:09,991"
There is.

791
"00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,162"
Come on. The old bat slaved all day.
Now eat it.

792
"00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,246"
I don't like it.

793
"00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,581"
It's delicious.

794
"00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,750"
Here.
You can have mine.

795
"00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,501"
All right. Don't eat it.
There's always something wrong.

796
"00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,297"
"Oh, if it's going to turn"
into a big thing--

797
"00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,257"
"Look, if you really can't stand"
"it, just don't eat it."

798
"00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29,719"
Mmm! It's delicious!
No undertaste at all.

799
"00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,932"
"Would you turn the record over, please?"

800
"00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,907"
"There, Daddy, do I get a gold star?"

801
"00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:51,908"
You get two of them.

802
"00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,118"
I'm sorry if I was stuffy.

803
"00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,329"
You were.

804
"00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,580"
...Is making a full circle
of the ball park...

805
"00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,041"
It's the pope at Yankee Stadium!

806
"00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,584"
...to his specially built
canopy at second base.

807
"00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,919"
"Christ, what a mob!"

808
"00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,712"
Listen to that crowd roar.

809
"00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,297"
"Everywhere the pope has been today,"

810
"00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,633"
he's received this type of reception.

811
"00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,718"
"As one man put it this afternoon,"

812
"00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,553"
"Perhaps we are being undignified,

813
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,597
but this is a special day."

814
"00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,391"
And a special day it has been.

815
"00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,143"
That's a great spot for
my Yamaha commercial.

816
"00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,103"
"Ha, ha, hal"

817
"00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,732"
I'd like to give you a brief summary
of today's historic happenings.

818
"00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:27,694"
Pope Paul VI arrived at 9:27 A.M...

819
"00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:30,905"
What is it?

820
"00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,700"
Dizzy.

821
"00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,747"
Hey.

822
"00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:43,793"
No wonder.

823
"00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,545"
All that booze.

824
"00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,505"
"Ha, ha."

825
"00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,424"
You didn't eat anything all
"day before dinner, huh?"

826
"00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,431"
Hey.

827
"00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,891"
Hey.

828
"00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,207"
Nice.

829
"00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,959"
Sleep is what you need.

830
"00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:25,960"
A good night's sleep.

831
"00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,297"
We have to make a baby.

832
"00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,883"
"Oh, we'll--"
we'll do it.

833
"00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,011"
Tomorrow.
There's plenty of time.

834
"00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,472"
Just a nap.

835
"00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,512"
Why are you taking them off?

836
"00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,680"
To make you more comfortable.

837
"00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,891"
I am more comfortable.

838
"00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,060"
"Sleep, Ro."

839
"00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,227"
Isn't Hutch coming with us?

840
"00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,480"
"Catholics only,"

841
"00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:12,650"
I wish we weren't bound
"by these prejudices,"

842
"00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,235"
"but, unfortunately--"

843
"00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,449"
"Easy, easy."

844
"00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,075"
You got her too high.

845
"00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,786"
Typhoon!
Typhoon!

846
"00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,539"
"It killed 55 people in London,"

847
"00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,124"
and it's heading this way!

848
"00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,925"
"You better go down below, miss."

849
"00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,282"
She's awake.
She sees.

850
"00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,741"
She don't see.

851
"00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,909"
"As long as she ate the mouse,"
she can't see nor hear.

852
"00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,202"
She's like dead.
Now sing.

853
"00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,881"
I'm sorry to hear

854
"00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:41,382"
you aren't feeling well.

855
"00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,385"
It's only the mouse bite.

856
"00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,596"
You'd better have your legs tied down

857
"00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,223"
in case of convulsions.

858
"00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,934"
"Yes, I suppose so."

859
"00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,771"
There's always a chance it was rabid.

860
"00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,398"
"If the music bothers you,"

861
"00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,276"
"let me know, and I'll have"
it stopped.

862
"00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,069"
"Oh, no, no, no."

863
"00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,739"
Please don't change the
program on my account.

864
"00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,365"
Try to sleep.

865
"00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:09,285"
We'll be waiting up on deck.

866
"00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,159"
This is no dream!
This is really happening!

867
"00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,838"
They tell me you have
been bitten by a mouse.

868
"00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,925"
Yes. That's why I couldn't
come to see you.

869
"00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,927"
That's all right.

870
"00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,345"
We wouldn't want you to
jeopardize your health.

871
"00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,183"
"Am I forgiven, Father?"

872
"00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,476"
"Oh, absolutely."

873
"00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,200"
"Hey, it's after 9:00."

874
"00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,495"
Uhm.

875
"00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,249"
Five minutes.

876
"00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,209"
I have to be at Alan's at 10:00.

877
"00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,337"
Eat out.

878
"00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:44,505"
Like hell I will.

879
"00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:56,934"
What time is it?

880
"00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:58,519"
It's 10 after 9:00.

881
"00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:02,481"
What time did I go to sleep?

882
"00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:03,899"
You didn't go to sleep.

883
"00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,068"
You passed out.

884
"00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,863"
"From now on you get cocktails or wine,"

885
"00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,364"
not cocktails and
"wine, hmm?"

886
"00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,075"
The dreams I had.

887
"00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:18,998"
Don't yell.

888
"00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,249"
I already filed them down.

889
"00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,045"
I didn't want to miss baby night.

890
"00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,005"
A couple of my nails were ragged.

891
"00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,840"
You-- While I was out?

892
"00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,968"
"And it was kind of fun, in"
"a ""necrophile” sort of way."

893
"00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:37,183"
I dreamed someone was raping me.

894
"00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,852"
"I don't know, someone inhuman."

895
"00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,145"
Thanks a lot!

896
"00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,232"
What's the matter?

897
"00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:46,317"
Nothing.

898
"00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,154"
I didn't want to miss the night.

899
"00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,991"
We could've done it this
morning or tonight.

900
"00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:56,368"
Last night wasn't the only split second.

901
"00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,037"
I was a little bit loaded
"myself, you know?"

902
"00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,809"
Oh! Hello there.
Did ya like it?

903
"00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,311"
"Oh, yes."

904
"00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,230"
I think I put a little too
much cream de cocoa in it.

905
"00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,689"
"No, no."
It was delicious.

906
"00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:26,649"
You'll have to give me the recipe.

907
"00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,109"
"Yeah, love to."
"Oh, listen, you going shopping?"

908
"00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,444"
"Do me a teeny favor, will ya?"

909
"00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,072"
"Get me six eggs, a small instant Sanka."
I'll pay you later.

910
"00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:34,949"
Right.
Bye-bye.

911
"00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,450"
Ahh.

912
"00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,502"
Don't you think we ought
to talk about it?

913
"00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,128"
About what?

914
"00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,673"
The way you haven't been looking at me.

915
"00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,882"
What are you talking about?

916
"00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:52,883"
I've been looking at you.

917
"00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,385"
You haven't.

918
"00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,511"
"Why, sure, I have."

919
"00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:57,513"
"Now, what is it?"
What's the matter?

920
"00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,726"
Nothing. Never mind.

921
"00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,477"
"No, no."
Don't say that.

922
"00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:03,811"
What is it?

923
"00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,480"
Nothing.

924
"00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,399"
"Look, honey, I--"

925
"00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,609"
I know I've been preoccupied
"with the part and all,"

926
"00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,152"
but it is important.

927
"00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,612"
That doesn't mean I don't love you.

928
"00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,254"
It was due on Friday.

929
"00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,340"
It was?

930
"00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,550"
Mm-hmm.

931
"00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,428"
It'll probably come tonight or tomorrow.

932
"00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,096"
Wanna bet?
Yeah.

933
"00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:40,180"
A quarter.
Okay.

934
"00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,599"
You're going to lose.

935
"00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,143"
"Shut up, will you?"
You're getting me all jumpy.

936
"00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,020"
It's only been two days.

937
"00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,396"
When will I know?

938
"00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,816"
I'll call you just as soon
as I get the results.

939
"00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,568"
I like to do a general examination

940
"00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,320"
just to know something more.

941
"00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,866"
It was Elise Dunstan who recommended
"you to me, Doctor."

942
"00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,409"
"Oh, yes."
How is she?

943
"00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,620"
She's fine.
And the boys are great.

944
"00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,704"
Did you deliver them?

945
"00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,289"
"No, just the last."

946
"00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,540"
Universal hemoglobin.

947
"00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,125"
"Yes, Doctor."

948
"00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,931"
We went to see The Fantasticks.

949
"00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,183"
Did you?

950
"00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,559"
Mmm.
Did you enjoy it?

951
"00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:26,769"
Yeah.

952
"00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,062"
Good.

953
"00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:35,069"
Hello?

954
"00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,236"
Mrs. Woodhouse?

955
"00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,072"
Dr. Hill?
Congratulations.

956
"00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,740"
Really?

957
"00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,033"
Really.

958
"00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,411"
Are you there?

959
"00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,790"
"Uh, yes, um, what happens now?"

960
"00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,541"
You come see me next month.

961
"00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,044"
You get those natalin pills.
One a day.

962
"00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,712"
I'll mail you forms for the hospital.

963
"00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,714"
"Uh, when will it be?"

964
"00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:58,092"
It works out to be June 28th.

965
"00:52:58,092 --> 00:52:59,927"
That sounds so far away.

966
"00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,512"
Itis.

967
"00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,888"
"One more thing, Mrs. Woodhouse,"

968
"00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,306"
we'd like another blood sample.

969
"00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:05,974"
"Oh, yes, of course."

970
"00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,893"
What for?

971
"00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,895"
"The nurse didn't take enough,"

972
"00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,355"
so would you drop by and see her?

973
"00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,857"
"But I am pregnant, aren't I?"

974
"00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,109"
"Oh, yes, it's just for blood samp--"

975
"00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,777"
Blood sugar and so forth.

976
"00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,363"
But you're pregnant.
Don't worry.

977
"00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:22,116"
All right.
"Well, I'll come in on Monday."

978
"00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,367"
All right.
Don't forget the pills.

979
"00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:24,618"
"No, I won't."

980
"00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,245"
"Good-bye, Mrs. Woodhouse."
"Good-bye, Dr. Hill."

981
"00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:29,790"
Blood sugar?

982
"00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:47,558"
What's that?

983
"00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,148"
Oh! That's great.
That's just great.

984
"00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,983"
Father.

985
"00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,818"
Mother.
"Heh, heh."

986
"00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,488"
"Guy, Guy, listen."

987
"00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:04,658"
"Let's, uh, make this"
"a new beginning, okay?"

988
"00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,452"
"A new openness in talking to each other,"

989
"00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,829"
because we haven't been open.

990
"00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:12,291"
That's true.
I've been so goddamned self-centered.

991
"00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,251"
That's what the whole trouble is.

992
"00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:15,878"
"You know I love you, don't you, Ro?"

993
"00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,337"
I do.
I swear to God

994
"00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,964"
I'm going to be as open and--

995
"00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,174"
It's my fault as much as yours.

996
"00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,092"
"No, bull, it's mine."
Now you bear with me.

997
"00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,635"
"I'm gonna try and do better, you hear?"

998
"00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,304"
"Oh, Guy."

999
"00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,772"
"Ha, ha, ha."

1000
"00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,356"
What?

1001
"00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,691"
It's...

1002
"00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,652"
a fine way for parents
to be carrying on.

1003
"00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,488"
Hey.

1004
"00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,781"
Know what I'd love to do?

1005
"00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,282"
What?

1006
"00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:46,992"
Tell Minnie and Roman.

1007
"00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,619"
"Oh, I know, I know."

1008
"00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,579"
"It's, uh--"

1009
"00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:53,165"
"It's, uh, supposed to be"
"a deep, dark secret,"

1010
"00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:56,668"
but I already told them
that we were trying.

1011
"00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,795"
They were so pleased.

1012
"00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:00,881"
Tell them.

1013
"00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,049"
Back in two minutes?

1014
"00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,342"
Mm-hmm.

1015
"00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,395"
You're pregnant.

1016
"00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:19,733"
Another blood sample.

1017
"00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,443"
Ta-da!

1018
"00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:24,863"
"Now, that's what I call good news!"

1019
"00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:27,658"
"Aw, honey, congratulations."

1020
"00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,243"
Thank you.

1021
"00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,744"
"Best wishes, Rosemary."

1022
"00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,037"
Thank you very much.

1023
"00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,539"
We are more pleased than we can say.

1024
"00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,165"
"We didn't have any champagne on hand,"

1025
"00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,708"
but this will do just as nicely.

1026
"00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,210"
"When are you due, dear?"

1027
"00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,920"
June 28th.

1028
"00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:41,421"
"Oh, that'll be so exciting."

1029
"00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,798"
"Listen, dear, you got a good doctor?"

1030
"00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,299"
"Oh, yes, a very good one."

1031
"00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,134"
One of the top obstetricians

1032
"00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,053"
is a dear friend of
"ours, Abe Sapirstein."

1033
"00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,888"
Delivers all the society babies.

1034
"00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,306"
Abe Sapirstein?

1035
"00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,600"
One of the finest obstetricians
in the country.

1036
"00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:55,269"
Wasn't he on Open End
a couple of years ago?

1037
"00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,770"
That's right.

1038
"00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:57,896"
Ro?

1039
"00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:59,356"
Uh--

1040
"00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,191"
"Well, what about Dr. Hill?"

1041
"00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:02,818"
Don't worry about Hill.
I'll tell him something.

1042
"00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,361"
You know me.

1043
"00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,196"
"Listen, I won't let you"
go to no Dr. Hill

1044
"00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:07,531"
nobody ever heard of.

1045
"00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,908"
The best is what you're going
"to have, young lady."

1046
"00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,243"
"Where's your telephone, huh?"

1047
"00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,744"
It's in the bedroom.

1048
"00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:15,289"
He's a brilliant man.
Very sensitive.

1049
"00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,082"
"Ro, sit down, sit down."

1050
"00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,542"
"No, I'm fine."

1051
"00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:21,336"
"Abe, Minnie."
Fine.

1052
"00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,671"
"Listen, Abe, a dear friend of ours"

1053
"00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,923"
Just found out today she's pregnant.

1054
"00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,675"
"Yeah, isn't it?"
I'm in her apartment right now.

1055
"00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,095"
We told her you'd be glad
to take care of her.

1056
"00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,598"
You wouldn't charge her none of your
fancy society prices neither.

1057
"00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:35,309"
"Well, just wait a minute."

1058
"00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:36,560"
"Rosemary, tomorrow morning at 11:00?"

1059
"00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,353"
All right.

1060
"00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,856"
"Yeah, 11:00's fine, Abe."
Uh-huh.

1061
"00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,900"
"Yeah, well, you, too."

1062
"00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,193"
"No, no, no, no, not at all."

1063
"00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,820"
All right.
"Well, let's hope so."

1064
"00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,571"
Good-bye.

1065
"00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,282"
"Well, there you are."

1066
"00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:51,575"
"Thanks a million, Minnie."

1067
"00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:53,785"
I don't know how to thank
"you, both of you."

1068
"00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,371"
"Just have a fine, healthy"
"baby, that's all."

1069
"00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,207"
"My, I can't wait to tell Laura-Louise."

1070
"00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,335"
Oh--

1071
"00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:04,087"
"Uh, please don't tell anyone"
"else, not right away."

1072
"00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,380"
"No, she's right."

1073
"00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,174"
There's plenty of time.

1074
"00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,760"
"Now, to a fine, healthy baby."

1075
"00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:10,802"
"Hear, hear."

1076
"00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:11,845"
Hear!

1077
"00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,848"
Andy.

1078
"00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,852"
Or Susan.

1079
"00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,688"
Susan.

1080
"00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:10,320"
Please don't read books.

1081
"00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:13,407"
No pregnancy was ever exactly like
the ones described in the books.

1082
"00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:17,327"
And don't listen to
"your friends, either."

1083
"00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,996"
No two pregnancies are ever alike.

1084
"00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,416"
Dr. Hill prescribed vitamin pills.

1085
"00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,251"
No pills.

1086
"00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,421"
Minnie Castevet has a herbarium.

1087
"00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,006"
I'm going to have her make
a daily drink for you

1088
"00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:31,550"
"that'll be fresher, safer,"
and more vitamin-rich

1089
"00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,843"
than any pills on the market.

1090
"00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,764"
"Any questions you have,"
call me night or day.

1091
"00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:39,349"
"Call me, not your Aunt Fanny."

1092
"00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:40,267"
That's what I'm here for.

1093
"00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,977"
Here.

1094
"00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,437"
What's in it?

1095
"00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,565"
"Snips and snails and puppy dogs"" tails."

1096
"00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,316"
"That's fine, but what if we"
want a girl?

1097
"00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,527"
Do you?

1098
"00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:52,320"
It would be nice if the
first one were a boy.

1099
"00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,947"
"Well, there you are."

1100
"00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,036"
"No, really, what is"
init?

1101
"00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,455"
"A raw egg, gelatin, herbs."

1102
"00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,373"
Tannis root?

1103
"00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:06,126"
Some of that along with
some other things.

1104
"00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:09,171"
"Don't be so violent, Harry."
"If you want to be stupid,"

1105
"00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,922"
"be nonviolent stupid,"

1106
"00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,216"
I'm in love with no one.

1107
"00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,634"
Especially not your fat wife.

1108
"00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,137"
I'm a hopeless cripple--

1109
"00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:20,599"
What's that?

1110
"00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,478"
I-I've been to Vidal Sassoon.

1111
"00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:26,688"
Don't tell me you paid for that.

1112
"00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:30,942"
"Guy, I have a pain."

1113
"00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,652"
Where?

1114
"00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,029"
Here.

1115
"00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,197"
Just now?

1116
"00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,531"
Since Monday.

1117
"00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:38,533"
A sharp pain.

1118
"00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,118"
Did you see Sapirstein?

1119
"00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,328"
I'm seeing him on Wednesday.

1120
"00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:42,496"
This is ridiculous.

1121
"00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,372"
Why don't you see Sapirstein?

1122
"00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,540"
Why didn't you say anything?

1123
"00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,875"
I see him Wednesday regular.

1124
"00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,712"
An entirely natural expansion
of the pelvis.

1125
"00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,464"
You can fight it with ordinary aspirin.

1126
"00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,800"
I was afraid it might be
an ectopic pregnancy.

1127
"00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,052"
Ectopic?

1128
"00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,970"
I thought you weren't going
"to read books, Rosemary."

1129
"00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,680"
It was staring at me in the drugstore.

1130
"01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,140"
All it did was worry you.

1131
"01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:04,351"
Will you go home and
"throw it away, please?"

1132
"01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,186"
The pains will be gone in two days.

1133
"01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,064"
Ectopic pregnancy.

1134
"01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,818"
I look awful.

1135
"01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,320"
What are you talking about?

1136
"01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,406"
You look great.

1137
"01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:00,824"
It's that haircut that looks awful.

1138
"01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,493"
"You want the truth, honey,"

1139
"01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,078"
that's the worst mistake you ever made.

1140
"01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,157"
My Goa!

1141
"01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,950"
It's Vidal Sassoon.

1142
"01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,118"
It's very in.

1143
"01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,703"
What's wrong with you?

1144
"01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,330"
Do I look that bad?

1145
"01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,956"
Terrible!

1146
"01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:51,791"
You're not on one of those
"Zen diets, are you?"

1147
"01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,126"
No.

1148
"01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,128"
Then what is it?
Have you seen a doctor?

1149
"01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:57,505"
"Hutch, I might as well tell you."

1150
"01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,632"
I'm pregnant.

1151
"01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,634"
"Oh, rubbish."

1152
"01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:03,386"
Pregnant women gain weight.
They don't lose it.

1153
"01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,180"
I don't sleep well.

1154
"01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:08,141"
"I have stiff joints or something,"
so I get a pain.

1155
"01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:09,768"
Nothing serious.

1156
"01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,603"
"Well, congratulations."

1157
"01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:13,396"
You must be very happy.

1158
"01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,148"
"Oh, I am."
We both are.

1159
"01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,151"
Who's your obstetrician?

1160
"01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,861"
Abraham Sapirstein.

1161
"01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,822"
Oh! He delivered two of
my daughter's babies.

1162
"01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,699"
He's one of the best in the city.

1163
"01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,076"
When did you see him last?

1164
"01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,535"
"Um, yesterday."

1165
"01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,912"
And?

1166
"01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,664"
And he says it's fairly common.

1167
"01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:33,833"
How much weight have you lost?

1168
"01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:37,087"
"Uh, 3 pounds."

1169
"01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:39,005"
Nonsense. You've lost
far more than that.

1170
"01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,509"
It's perfectly normal to
lose a little at first.

1171
"01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,135"
"Later on, I'll be gaining."

1172
"01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,763"
Well...

1173
"01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:49,683"
we must assume Dr. Sapirstein
knows whereof he speaks.

1174
"01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,601"
He should.
He charges enough.

1175
"01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,520"
We're getting bargain rates.

1176
"01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,771"
Our neighbors are close friends of his.

1177
"01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:56,189"
Oh?

1178
"01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:57,857"
I'll go.
Stay where you are.

1179
"01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,276"
It hurts less when I move around.

1180
"01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,614"
"Oh, I was just talking about you."

1181
"01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:06,032"
"Favorably, I hope."

1182
"01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,784"
Do you need anything from outside?

1183
"01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:09,494"
No. Thank you for asking.

1184
"01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,413"
Is Guy home already?

1185
"01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,872"
He won't be home till 6:00.

1186
"01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,249"
Oh.

1187
"01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,709"
A friend of ours is here.

1188
"01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,628"
Would you--
Would you like to meet him?

1189
"01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,422"
If I won't be intruding.

1190
"01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,881"
No. Please come in.

1191
"01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,438"
"Hutch, this is Roman Castevet."

1192
"01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,939"
Edward Hutchins.

1193
"01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,899"
How do you do?
"Oh, how are you, sir?"

1194
"01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,735"
I was just telling Hutch
that it was you and Minnie

1195
"01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,111"
who sent me to Dr. Sapirstein.

1196
"01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:45,405"
"Oh, so Rosemary has told"
you the good news.

1197
"01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,781"
"Yes, she has."

1198
"01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,575"
We must see that she
gets plenty of rest.

1199
"01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,452"
I was a bit alarmed by her appearance.

1200
"01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,162"
"Well, she has lost some weight,"

1201
"01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,247"
but that's quite normal
for the early months.

1202
"01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,916"
"Later on, she'll gain,"
probably far too much.

1203
"01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,919"
So I gather.
Please sit down.

1204
"01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:02,589"
Mrs. Castevet makes a vitamin
drink for me every day

1205
"01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,257"
from fresh herbs she grows.

1206
"01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:07,093"
"Yes, all according to Dr. Sapirstein's"
"directions, of course."

1207
"01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,054"
He's inclined to be suspicious

1208
"01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,514"
of commercially prepared vitamin pills.

1209
"01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,933"
Indeed? But surely they're manufactured

1210
"01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,727"
under every imaginable safeguard.

1211
"01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:18,104"
"That's quite true, but commercial pills"

1212
"01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:20,148"
can sit for months on a druggist's shelf

1213
"01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,609"
and lose a great deal of
their original potency.

1214
"01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,110"
I hadn't thought of that.

1215
"01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,113"
I like the idea of having everything
fresh and natural.

1216
"01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:30,241"
I'll bet expectant mothers
chewed bits of tannis root

1217
"01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,118"
when nobody'd even heard
of vitamin pills.

1218
"01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,661"
Tannis root?

1219
"01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,955"
It's one of the herbs
she puts in the drink.

1220
"01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,999"
Oris it an herb?
Can a root be an herb?

1221
"01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,502"
You sure you don't mean
anise or orris root?

1222
"01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,628"
"No, tannis."

1223
"01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,004"
Hmm.

1224
"01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:45,298"
Look.

1225
"01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,468"
"It's good luck, too."

1226
"01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:50,804"
Ish!

1227
"01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,056"
Ha.

1228
"01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,309"
"Doesn't look like, uh, root matter,"

1229
"01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:58,978"
more like mold or fungus of some kind.

1230
"01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,399"
Is it ever called by any other name?

1231
"01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,942"
"Not to my knowledge, no."

1232
"01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:09,531"
Tannis. I must look it up
in the encyclopedia.

1233
"01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,950"
What a pretty holder or
charm or whatever it is.

1234
"01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,910"
The Castevets gave it to me.

1235
"01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:15,245"
You and your wife

1236
"01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:16,538"
seem to be taking better
care of Rosemary

1237
"01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,872"
than her own parents.

1238
"01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,250"
We're very fond of her.
"And of Guy, too."

1239
"01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,544"
"Now if you'll excuse me,"
I'll have to go.

1240
"01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,045"
My wife is waiting for me.

1241
"01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:25,630"
It's a pleasure to have met you.

1242
"01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:27,549"
"Oh, don't bother, Rosemary."

1243
"01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,175"
"We'll meet again, I'm sure."

1244
"01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,848"
I just noticed he has pierced ears.

1245
"01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,892"
Pierced ears and piercing eyes.

1246
"01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,394"
What's she like?

1247
"01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,230"
Nosy. Funny.

1248
"01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,191"
Guy's gotten very close to them.

1249
"01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,944"
I suppose they've become sort
of parent figures for him.

1250
"01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,699"
And you?

1251
"01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:57,537"
Sometimes I think they're
too friendly and helpful.

1252
"01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,707"
"Hey, what a surprise."

1253
"01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,000"
"How are you, Hutch?"
Good to see you.

1254
"01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,376"
You're the surprise.
What happened?

1255
"01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,420"
"They stopped for a rewrite,"
those dumb bastards.

1256
"01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,631"
"Ah, stay where you are."
Nobody move.

1257
"01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,216"
Would you like some coffee?

1258
"01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,426"
Love some.

1259
"01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,017"
Loot!

1260
"01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,768"
Seems congratulations are in order.

1261
"01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,853"
"Yeah, it's wonderful, isn't it?"

1262
"01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:23,104"
When's the baby due?

1263
"01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:24,898"
June 28th.

1264
"01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:26,191"
Did you know that Dr. Sapirstein

1265
"01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:28,401"
delivered two of Hutch's grandchildren?

1266
"01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,819"
Really?
Mmm.

1267
"01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:31,821"
I met your neighbor.

1268
"01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:34,199"
Roman Castevet.
"Oh, did you?"

1269
"01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,408"
"Funny old duck, isn't he?"

1270
"01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,410"
Did you ever notice he has pierced ears?

1271
"01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,996"
You're kidding.
"No, I'm not. I saw."

1272
"01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:41,831"
It's a shame we haven't
"seen more of you lately,"

1273
"01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:43,875"
but with me being so busy

1274
"01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:45,251"
"and Ro being the way she is,"

1275
"01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:46,503"
we really haven't seen anyone.

1276
"01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:47,921"
Perhaps we can have
dinner together soon.

1277
"01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:49,214"
"You're not going, are you?"

1278
"01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,590"
"Thanks for the coffee, my dear."

1279
"01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:52,300"
"Thank you for coming, my dear."

1280
"01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,932"
This isn't mine.
It must be yours.

1281
"01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,600"
Right you are.

1282
"01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:03,144"
"Have you thought about names,"
or is it too soon?

1283
"01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,063"
"Andrew or Douglas if it's a boy,"

1284
"01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,731"
Melinda or Sarah if it's a girl.

1285
"01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,274"
Sarah?
What happened to Susan?

1286
"01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,318"
"Say, is there another of these around?"

1287
"01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,653"
Oh.

1288
"01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,617"
"I don't see it, Hutch."

1289
"01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:20,119"
"No, it's not here."

1290
"01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,829"
I probably left it at the city center.

1291
"01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,414"
I'll stop back there.

1292
"01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,083"
"Let's really have that dinner, shall we?"

1293
"01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,793"
Definitely.
Next week.

1294
"01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,628"
Bye.
Bye-bye.

1295
"01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:30,255"
Bye.
Bye.

1296
"01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,305"
It was a nice surprise.

1297
"01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,140"
Guess what he said.

1298
"01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:43,768"
What?

1299
"01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,061"
I look terrible.

1300
"01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:47,313"
Good old Hutch.

1301
"01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,023"
He's spreading cheer wherever he goes.

1302
"01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,483"
"I'm going to get a paper, honey."

1303
"01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,404"
He's a professional crepehanger.

1304
"01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:55,947"
He's not a professional crepehanger.

1305
"01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:58,032"
Then he's one of the
top-ranking amateurs.

1306
"01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,170"
Hello.

1307
"01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,548"
"Oh, uh, she's not feeling too well."

1308
"01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:16,050"
"Well, I think she's asleep."

1309
"01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:17,552"
All right.

1310
"01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:20,680"
"Oh, she could be, yeah."

1311
"01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:23,975"
"All right, can you hold on a minute?"

1312
"01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,188"
It's Hutch.
He wants to speak to you.

1313
"01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:30,690"
Oh.

1314
"01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:33,067"
"I told him you were resting,"

1315
"01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,152"
but he said he couldn't wait.

1316
"01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:43,244"
Hutch?

1317
"01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,038"
"Tell me, dear, do you go out at all?"

1318
"01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:49,459"
"Well, I-I haven't been going out. Why?"

1319
"01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,377"
Can you meet me tomorrow
morning at 11:00

1320
"01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,046"
in front of the Time-Life building?

1321
"01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,757"
"Yes, if you want me to."

1322
"01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,383"
What is it?
Can't you tell me now?

1323
"01:08:57,425 --> 01:08:58,843"
I'd rather not.

1324
"01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,720"
We can have an early lunch if you like.

1325
"01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:02,221"
That would be nice.

1326
"01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,140"
Good. 11:00 then?
Okay.

1327
"01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:05,808"
"Oh, did you find your glove?"

1328
"01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,226"
"No, they didn't have it."

1329
"01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,770"
"Good night, Rosemary."
Sleep well.

1330
"01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,313"
"You, too. Good night."

1331
"01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,273"
What was that?

1332
"01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:13,441"
He wants to talk to me.

1333
"01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,234"
What about?

1334
"01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,569"
I don't know.
He wouldn't say.

1335
"01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:20,406"
I think those boys' adventure
stories are going to his head.

1336
"01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,328"
Where are you meeting him?

1337
"01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:28,414"
"Uh, Time and Life building"
tomorrow at 11:00.

1338
"01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,544"
This is ridiculous.

1339
"01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,296"
You're pregnant.
I've got the yens.

1340
"01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:36,255"
I'm getting an ice-cream cone.
You want one?

1341
"01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:37,882"
"Yeah, I'd love one."

1342
"01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,008"
Vanilla?

1343
"01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,677"
Okay.
Okay.

1344
"01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,242"
Hi.

1345
"01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,952"
"Minnie, I'm going out now,"

1346
"01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:07,453"
so I won't have my drink at 11:00.

1347
"01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,288"
"That's fine, dear."
Take it later.

1348
"01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,748"
"Buzz me when you get back, huh?"

1349
"01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,237"
"Pain, begone."
I will have no more of thee.

1350
"01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,066"
Yes?

1351
"01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,777"
Is this Edward Hutchins' apartment?

1352
"01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,111"
"Yes. Who is this, please?"

1353
"01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:23,654"
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.

1354
"01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,198"
I had an appointment with Mr. Hutchins.

1355
"01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:26,491"
Is he there?

1356
"01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:29,118"
Hello?

1357
"01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,495"
He was taken ill this morning.

1358
"01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:34,707"
Taken ill?
Yes.

1359
"01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,876"
He's in a deep coma at
St. Vincent's hospital.

1360
"01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:39,295"
That's awful.

1361
"01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:43,216"
I just spoke to him
last night about 10:30.

1362
"01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,884"
I spoke to him at 11:00.

1363
"01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:46,511"
Who is this?

1364
"01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,137"
"You don't know me, Rosemary."

1365
"01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:50,389"
"I'm Grace Cardiff, Hutch's friend."

1366
"01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:53,059"
"Um, do they know what's causing it?"

1367
"01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:54,811"
"No, they don't know yet."

1368
"01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,771"
"At the moment, he's"
totally unresponsive.

1369
"01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,149"
"Oh, I'm going to the hospital now."

1370
"01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:01,567"
Is there anything I can do?

1371
"01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:02,777"
Not really.

1372
"01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,863"
"All right, um, thank you."

1373
"01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,018"
No!

1374
"01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:39,063"
This is what I call the
long arm of coincidence!

1375
"01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,524"
"Ho, ho, ho!"

1376
"01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:44,610"
"I said to myself, as long"
"as Rosemary's going out,"

1377
"01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:47,280"
I might as well go out and do a
little bit of Christmas shopping.

1378
"01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,156"
Now here you are.
Here I am.

1379
"01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,367"
Isn't that something?

1380
"01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:53,828"
"Aw, darling, what's the matter?"
You feel all right?

1381
"01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:59,125"
"Aw... aw, you poor thing."

1382
"01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,459"
You know what I think?

1383
"01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,128"
I think we better be going home now.

1384
"01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:03,546"
What do you say?

1385
"01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:05,590"
"No, no, you have your shopping to do."

1386
"01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,341"
"Ah, shoot, there's two more weeks."

1387
"01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,277"
It'll stop any day now.

1388
"01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:28,654"
It's like a wire inside me

1389
"01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,531"
getting tighter and tighter.

1390
"01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:33,534"
Usually older women with
less flexible joints

1391
"01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:34,660"
have this sort of trouble.

1392
"01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:36,829"
I'm not going out anymore.

1393
"01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:37,997"
You don't have to.

1394
"01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,999"
One minute to go!

1395
"01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,170"
"Rosemary, I want you to meet Dr. Shand."

1396
"01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,172"
He used to be a famous dentist.

1397
"01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,174"
He made the chain for your charm.

1398
"01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,800"
"Oh, how do you do?"

1399
"01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,093"
"Come on, sweetie."

1400
"01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:52,511"
Put this wonderful hat on.

1401
"01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:55,014"
"Doctor, come over here."

1402
"01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:56,307"
"Minnie, Minnie."

1403
"01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:57,892"
Happy new year.

1404
"01:13:57,934 --> 01:13:59,352"
Have a good year.

1405
"01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:01,354"
Happy new year.

1406
"01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:05,983"
To 1966!

1407
"01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:07,777"
The year 1!

1408
"01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,081"
What the hell are you doing?

1409
"01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,083"
Planning the menu.

1410
"01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:07,461"
We're having a party
a week from Saturday.

1411
"01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:10,297"
It's for our old--

1412
"01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,757"
"I mean, our young friends."

1413
"01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:13,884"
Minnie and Roman are not invited.

1414
"01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,429"
Neither is Laura-Louise.

1415
"01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,222"
Nor is Dr. Sapirstein.

1416
"01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,640"
It's going to be a very special party.

1417
"01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:21,017"
You have to be under 60 to get in.

1418
"01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,234"
Well.

1419
"01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,445"
"For a minute there, I didn't"
think I was going to make it.

1420
"01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:33,571"
"You'll make it, all right."

1421
"01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:35,823"
You can be bartender.

1422
"01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,033"
"Oh, swell."

1423
"01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,578"
Do you really think it's
such a good idea?

1424
"01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,205"
I think it's the best idea
I've had in months.

1425
"01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:44,373"
Don't you think you ought to check

1426
"01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:45,875"
with Dr. Sapirstein first?

1427
"01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:48,044"
What for? I'm just giving a party.

1428
"01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,962"
I'm not going to swim
the English Channel.

1429
"01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:51,005"
What about the pain?

1430
"01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:54,383"
"Oh, haven't you heard?"

1431
"01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,969"
It'll go away in a day or two.

1432
"01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:58,763"
That looks interesting.

1433
"01:15:58,763 --> 01:15:59,638"
What's it for?

1434
"01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,724"
We're having some people
over on Saturday.

1435
"01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:03,809"
"Oh, you feel up to entertaining?"

1436
"01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:05,770"
"Yes, I do."
These are old friends

1437
"01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,480"
I haven't seen in a long time.

1438
"01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,482"
They don't even know yet
that I'm pregnant.

1439
"01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:10,733"
I'll give you a hand if you like.

1440
"01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,318"
I'll help you dish things out.

1441
"01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,487"
"No, thank you, Minnie, but I can manage."

1442
"01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:15,905"
"It's going to be a buffet,"

1443
"01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:17,573"
"and we're getting a bartender, so--"

1444
"01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:19,658"
I'll help you take the coats.

1445
"01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:22,661"
"No, really, you do too"
much for me as it is.

1446
"01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,499"
"Well, let me know if"
you change your mind.

1447
"01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:27,666"
Drink your drink now.

1448
"01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:31,170"
I'd rather not.

1449
"01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:32,797"
Not right this minute.

1450
"01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,090"
I'll drink it in a little while.

1451
"01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:36,675"
It don't do to let it stand.

1452
"01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,344"
"No, I won't wait too long."

1453
"01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:39,595"
"You go on back,"

1454
"01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:41,180"
and I'll bring the glass
back to you later.

1455
"01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:43,015"
I'll wait.
I'll save you the walk.

1456
"01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:45,351"
You'll do no such thing.
It makes me very nervous

1457
"01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:46,352"
when people watch me cook.

1458
"01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:47,645"
"Now, scoot."

1459
"01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,522"
Don't let it stand too long.

1460
"01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:50,940"
It's going to lose its vitamins.

1461
"01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:05,830"
"You dirty, stinking secret-keeper."
Congratulations!

1462
"01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:08,040"
Congratulations.
Thank you.

1463
"01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,041"
"Hey, Rosie."

1464
"01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,001"
Yeah?

1465
"01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,254"
Bob and Leo got stuck
"at another party, dear,"

1466
"01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,421"
but they'll be over right away.

1467
"01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:15,631"
"Oh, fine."

1468
"01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:19,635"
You're so lucky.
It's a fantastic house.

1469
"01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,137"
Hi.

1470
"01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,682"
It's been so long.

1471
"01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:25,975"
You look like a piece of chalk.

1472
"01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,770"
"You make him feed you, love."

1473
"01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:34,775"
Adrian Marcato lived here.

1474
"01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,110"
And the Trench sisters.

1475
"01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,403"
Trent sisters?

1476
"01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:38,654"
Trench. They ate little children.

1477
"01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:40,656"
He doesn't just mean
they ate them.

1478
"01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:41,866"
He means they ate
them.

1479
"01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,749"
I made their first one strong
"to get them happy,"

1480
"01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,251"
"then I go light and conserve, eh?"

1481
"01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:53,586"
"Rosie, do you feel okay?"

1482
"01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:54,920"
You look a little tired.

1483
"01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,883"
Thanks for the understatement.

1484
"01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:02,595"
How do you like C.C. Hill?

1485
"01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:04,096"
Isn't he a dream boy?

1486
"01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,514"
"Mm-hmm, but I-I--"

1487
"01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:07,016"
I'm not going to him.

1488
"01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:09,435"
You're not?

1489
"01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:12,146"
I've got another doctor named
"Sapirstein, an older man."

1490
"01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:14,607"
"Oh, congratulations, Papa."

1491
"01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:16,025"
Thanks. Weren't nothing to it.

1492
"01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:17,651"
"Ro, I'm going to take that dip inside."

1493
"01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,196"
"Oh, yeah, please."
See my flowers?

1494
"01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,697"
Yeah.

1495
"01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,449"
"Elise, will you give me a hand?"

1496
"01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:24,909"
"Oh, yeah, sure."

1497
"01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:33,209"
"Hey, whatever happened to the other guy?"
Is he still blind?

1498
"01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,836"
Donald Baumgart?
"Well, you know who he is."

1499
"01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,338"
He's the boy that Zoe Piper
lives with.

1500
"01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,131"
He's writing a play.

1501
"01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,424"
Is he still blind?

1502
"01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:42,760"
Yeah. He's going through hell

1503
"01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:43,969"
trying to make the adjustment.

1504
"01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,305"
"He dictates, and Zoe writes."

1505
"01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:55,689"
Are you all right?

1506
"01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,485"
"Yeah, I'm fine."

1507
"01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:00,945"
I just had a cramp for a minute.

1508
"01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,739"
Don't cry.
It's all right.

1509
"01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:04,490"
It's good for her.

1510
"01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:05,991"
Let her cry it out.

1511
"01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:07,117"
"It's all right, darling."
It's all right.

1512
"01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:08,827"
"Sit down, sit down."

1513
"01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:15,417"
"Hey, let me in."

1514
"01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:16,627"
"Sorry, girls only."

1515
"01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:17,670"
I want to talk to Rosemary.

1516
"01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:19,004"
You can't.
She's busy.

1517
"01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,965"
I have to wash these--
Use the bathroom.

1518
"01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:27,805"
It hurts so much.

1519
"01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,682"
I'm so afraid the baby's gonna die.

1520
"01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,350"
When did the pain start?

1521
"01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:34,019"
um...

1522
"01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,854"
"in, uh, November."

1523
"01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,023"
November?
What?

1524
"01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,151"
You have been in pain
"since November,"

1525
"01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,903"
and he's not doing anything
to help you?

1526
"01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:44,863"
He says it's gonna stop.

1527
"01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:47,366"
Why don't you go to see another doctor?

1528
"01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:48,993"
"No, he's very good."

1529
"01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,704"
He was on Open End.

1530
"01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,914"
He sounds like a sadistic nut.

1531
"01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:56,250"
"Rosemary, pain like that"

1532
"01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:58,669"
is a warning that something isn't right.

1533
"01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:01,547"
Go see Dr. Hill.

1534
"01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:03,632"
Go see anybody besides that-- that--

1535
"01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:05,509"
That nut.

1536
"01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:07,386"
You can't go on suffering like this.

1537
"01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:09,138"
I won't have an abortion.

1538
"01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:11,598"
Nobody's telling you
to have an abortion.

1539
"01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,267"
Just go to see another
"doctor, that's all."

1540
"01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:24,445"
The thing to do now is move.

1541
"01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,613"
Guy?

1542
"01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:27,990"
Yeah?

1543
"01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:30,159"
I'm going to Dr. Hill Monday morning.

1544
"01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:35,539"
Dr. Sapirstein is either
"lying, or he's--"

1545
"01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,791"
"I don't know, out of his mind."

1546
"01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,085"
Pain like this is a warning
something's wrong.

1547
"01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,337"
Rosemary--

1548
"01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:44,214"
And I'm not drinking Minnie's
drink anymore.

1549
"01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,759"
I want vitamins and pills
like everyone else.

1550
"01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:50,429"
I haven't drunk it for
the last three days.

1551
"01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:51,430"
I've thrown it away.

1552
"01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:52,681"
You've what?

1553
"01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:54,433"
I've made my own drink.

1554
"01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:58,312"
Is that what those bitches
were giving you in there?

1555
"01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,607"
And is that their hint for today?

1556
"01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:02,941"
They're my friends--

1557
"01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:05,611"
They're a bunch of not
very bright bitches

1558
"01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:07,738"
who ought to mind their
own goddamn business!

1559
"01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,074"
All they said was get a second opinion.

1560
"01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:11,784"
"Rosemary, you got the best"
doctor in New York.

1561
"01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:12,951"
You know who Dr. Hill is?

1562
"01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:14,495"
He's a charlie nobody.

1563
"01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:15,871"
That's who he is!

1564
"01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:19,249"
I'm tired of hearing how
great Dr. Sapirstein is.

1565
"01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:22,044"
"Well, we'll have to pay Sapirstein."

1566
"01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:24,463"
We'll have to pay Hill.
It's out of the question.

1567
"01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:26,382"
"No, I'm not changing."

1568
"01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:28,967"
I just wanna go to Dr. Hill
and get a second opinion.

1569
"01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:30,761"
"I won't let you do it, Ro."

1570
"01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:32,971"
"I mean, because it's, uh--"

1571
"01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:34,473"
It's not fair to Sapirstein.

1572
"01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:37,351"
Not fair to--

1573
"01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,145"
What are you talking about?

1574
"01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,939"
What about what's fair to me?

1575
"01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,233"
You want a second opinion?

1576
"01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:47,820"
You tell Sapirstein and let
him decide who gives it.

1577
"01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:50,531"
No! I want Dr. Hill!

1578
"01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,074"
At least have that much courtesy--
"If you won't pay,"

1579
"01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:53,283"
then I'll--

1580
"01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:58,997"
Ro?

1581
"01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:02,126"
Rosemary?
What is it?

1582
"01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,003"
It stopped.

1583
"01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,507"
What?

1584
"01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:10,676"
The pain stopped just like that.

1585
"01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,386"
Stopped?
Stopped.

1586
"01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:16,390"
What was in that drink you made?

1587
"01:22:19,143 --> 01:22:20,269"
uh...

1588
"01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:23,147"
"eggs, milk, sug--"

1589
"01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,232"
Sugar.

1590
"01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:26,525"
What else?

1591
"01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:30,863"
Ha!
What else?

1592
"01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,867"
"Come on, Rosemary, for Christ's sakes,"
what else was in that drink?

1593
"01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:38,704"
It's alive!

1594
"01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:40,914"
"Guy, it's moving!"

1595
"01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,541"
It's alive!
It's all right!

1596
"01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,461"
Feel. Feel.

1597
"01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,045"
"Oh, yeah, I felt it."

1598
"01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:48,922"
Don't be scared.
It won't bite you.

1599
"01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:50,466"
It's wonderful.
It really is.

1600
"01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,051"
I feel it kicking.

1601
"01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:56,346"
It's alive!
It's moving!

1602
"01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:03,520"
"I'll, uh, clean up some of this mess."

1603
"01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:22,414"
Watch the walls.

1604
"01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,634"
"Thanks, boys."
Have one on the baby.

1605
"01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:34,927"
Thank you very much.

1606
"01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:05,874"
What's that for?

1607
"01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,918"
This is my hospital suitcase.

1608
"01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,337"
"Honey, you got three weeks."

1609
"01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:18,053"
Yes?

1610
"01:24:18,095 --> 01:24:19,638"
"Hello, Mrs. Cardiff."

1611
"01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:22,975"
No.

1612
"01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,394"
"Oh, my God."

1613
"01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:29,147"
"Oh, my God."

1614
"01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:31,608"
"Yes, of course I will."

1615
"01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:45,330"
Hutch is dead.

1616
"01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:52,504"
I feel awful.

1617
"01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:54,172"
"All this time, I didn't"
even think of him.

1618
"01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:18,905"
"Doris, we'll see you later."

1619
"01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,741"
I beg your pardon.

1620
"01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:23,035"
I'm Mrs. Woodhouse.
I knew your father.

1621
"01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:24,536"
"Oh, so you're Rosemary."

1622
"01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:25,871"
I'm terribly sorry.

1623
"01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:27,748"
Thank you.
This is my sister Edna.

1624
"01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,750"
How do you do?
And my husband.

1625
"01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,877"
How do you do?
I'm sorry to be late.

1626
"01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:34,004"
Excuse me.
Yes?

1627
"01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:36,715"
I'm Grace Cardiff.
I was hoping to meet you.

1628
"01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:38,050"
Thank you for calling me.

1629
"01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:40,510"
"I was going to mail this, but then"
I thought you would be here.

1630
"01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:43,096"
What is it?
A book.

1631
"01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:45,098"
Hutch regained consciousness
"at the end,"

1632
"01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,392"
and he thought it was the next morning.

1633
"01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,727"
"You know, when you had the appointment."

1634
"01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:50,896"
"Oh, yes."

1635
"01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:52,397"
"I wasn't there, but he told the doctor"

1636
"01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:54,900"
to make sure you got the
book that was on his desk.

1637
"01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:56,234"
Thank you.

1638
"01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:00,030"
"Oh, and I'm to tell you"
the name is an anagram.

1639
"01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,073"
The name of the book?

1640
"01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:03,367"
Apparently.

1641
"01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:05,369"
"He was delirious, so"
it's hard to be sure.

1642
"01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:32,896"
I heard you come in.

1643
"01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:34,272"
It certainly wasn't very long.

1644
"01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:35,941"
I was late.
I couldn't get a taxi.

1645
"01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:37,651"
"Oh, what a shame."

1646
"01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:38,777"
"Oh, you got mail already?"

1647
"01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:41,613"
Somebody gave it to me.

1648
"01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:43,281"
Here. I'll hold it.

1649
"01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:45,158"
Book.

1650
"01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:48,328"
"Oh, I know that house."

1651
"01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,621"
The Gilmores used to live there.

1652
"01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:51,289"
Oh?
Yeah.

1653
"01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:53,417"
I've been there lots of times.

1654
"01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,711"
Grace-- That's one of my favorite names.

1655
"01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:56,962"
Yes.

1656
"01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:58,463"
You need anything?

1657
"01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:00,924"
"Nothing, thank you."
"Take a nap, why don't you?"

1658
"01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:02,300"
I'm going to.
Yeah. Good-bye.

1659
"01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:47,012"
"Born in Glasgow in 1846,

1660
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:49,306
he was soon after brought to New York."

1661
"01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:51,349"
"He resided for several
years in the United St--

1662
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:55,353
He was attacked by a mob"
outside the Bram--

1663
"01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:59,191"
"Outside, not in the lobby."""

1664
"01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:11,703"
There are no witches.
Not really.

1665
"01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:16,792"
The name is an anagram.

1666
"01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,459"
"Now, that really makes sense."

1667
"01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:45,881"
Poor Hutch.

1668
"01:30:41,937 --> 01:30:43,355"
Ro?

1669
"01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:49,027"
What's with the chain?

1670
"01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:53,823"
What's the matter?

1671
"01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:57,369"
You all right?
I'm fine.

1672
"01:30:58,078 --> 01:30:59,454"
Oh.

1673
"01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:00,789"
"Oh, why, thank you."

1674
"01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:02,666"
How was the funeral?

1675
"01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:04,542"
Okay.

1676
"01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:06,544"
Got the shirt that was
in the New Yorker.

1677
"01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:14,219"
I got that shirt that
was in the New Yorker.

1678
"01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:16,221"
That's nice.

1679
"01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:17,555"
Do you know who Roman really is?

1680
"01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:19,224"
"What do you mean, honey?"

1681
"01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:21,726"
He's Adrian Marcato's son.
What?

1682
"01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:23,395"
Come here.

1683
"01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:24,980"
I want to show you something.

1684
"01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:29,859"
Roman Castevet is Steven
Marcato rearranged.

1685
"01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:33,697"
It's from Hutch.

1686
"01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:40,578"
Look.

1687
"01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,665"
And look here.

1688
"01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:46,459"
There he is when he was 13.
See the eyes?

1689
"01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:50,797"
Coincidence.

1690
"01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:53,758"
In the same house?
And look. Look here.

1691
"01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,428"
"Soon after that in August, 1886,

1692
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:58,221
his son Steven was born."

1693
"01:31:58,263 --> 01:31:59,556"
1886. Got it?

1694
"01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:01,099"
That makes him 79 now.

1695
"01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:03,476"
No coincidence.

1696
"01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:10,442"
"No, I guess not."

1697
"01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:12,027"
"He's Steven Marcato, all right."

1698
"01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:15,947"
Poor old geezer.
"With a crazy father like that,"

1699
"01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:18,116"
no wonder he switched his name around.

1700
"01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:20,452"
You don't think he's the same?

1701
"01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:22,454"
"What do you mean, a witch?"

1702
"01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:25,790"
"Ro, are you kidding?"
"Oh, Ro, honey."

1703
"01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:29,085"
His father was a martyr to it.

1704
"01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:30,295"
Do you know how he died?

1705
"01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,756"
"Honey, it's 1966."

1706
"01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:35,258"
This was published in 1933.

1707
"01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,718"
There were covens in Europe.

1708
"01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,804"
That's what they're called--
"the, um, congregation."

1709
"01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:42,474"
"Covens in Europe, in America,"
"and in Australia,"

1710
"01:32:42,474 --> 01:32:44,976"
and they have one right
"here, that whole bunch."

1711
"01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:47,729"
The parties with the singing and
"the flute and the chanting,"

1712
"01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:49,773"
those are esbats or Sabbaths
or whatever they're called.

1713
"01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:52,317"
"Honey, don't get excited."
"Read what they do, Guy."

1714
"01:32:52,317 --> 01:32:54,194"
They use blood in their rituals.

1715
"01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:57,030"
The blood that has the most
power is baby's blood.

1716
"01:32:57,072 --> 01:32:59,240"
"And they don't just use the blood,"
"they use the flesh, too."

1717
"01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:01,201"
"Rosemary, for God's sakes!"

1718
"01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:03,661"
They're not setting foot in
this apartment ever again.

1719
"01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:05,663"
They're not coming within
50 feet of the baby.

1720
"01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:08,541"
They're old people.
They have a bunch of old friends.

1721
"01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,127"
Dr. Shand happens to play the recorder.

1722
"01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:13,630"
I'm not taking any chances
with the baby's safety.

1723
"01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:15,006"
We're gonna sublet and move out.

1724
"01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,299"
We are not.

1725
"01:33:16,341 --> 01:33:17,801"
We'll talk about it later.

1726
"01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:24,182"
I don't think you ought
to read any more of that.

1727
"01:33:25,183 --> 01:33:26,184"
Just this last chapter.

1728
"01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:27,685"
"Not today, honey."

1729
"01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:29,771"
Look. Your hands are shaking.

1730
"01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:31,022"
Come on.
Give it to me.

1731
"01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:33,650"
Guy!
"I mean it, now."

1732
"01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:34,943"
Give it to me.

1733
"01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:46,538"
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.

1734
"01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:47,997"
"What'd you say the name was,"
Marchado?

1735
"01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:49,541"
Marcato.

1736
"01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:51,793"
He told me his father
was a coffee importer.

1737
"01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:53,545"
He told Guy he was a producer.

1738
"01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:54,921"
I understand how disturbed
you must be

1739
"01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:56,756"
to have him for a close neighbor.

1740
"01:33:56,798 --> 01:33:59,384"
I don't want anything more
to do with him or Minnie.

1741
"01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:01,386"
I can't take even the slightest chance

1742
"01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:02,554"
where the baby's safety's concerned.

1743
"01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:04,097"
Absolutely.
Any mother'd feel the same way.

1744
"01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,350"
Is there any chance at all

1745
"01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:09,602"
that maybe Minnie put something
harmful in those drinks

1746
"01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,062"
or in those little cakes?

1747
"01:34:11,104 --> 01:34:14,816"
"No, Rosemary, I'd have seen"
evidence of it long ago.

1748
"01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:16,359"
I won't take anything else
from them.

1749
"01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:17,861"
You won't have to.

1750
"01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,404"
I can give you some pills

1751
"01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:21,573"
that'll be adequate
these last few weeks.

1752
"01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:25,326"
"In a way, this may be the answer"

1753
"01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:27,412"
"to Minnie and Roman's problem, too."

1754
"01:34:27,412 --> 01:34:28,663"
What do you mean?

1755
"01:34:28,705 --> 01:34:30,373"
Roman's very ill.

1756
"01:34:30,415 --> 01:34:34,002"
"In fact, confidentially, he has"
no more than a month or two left.

1757
"01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:35,378"
I had no idea.

1758
"01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:38,423"
He wanted to pay a last visit to
a few of his favorite cities.

1759
"01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:39,632"
They didn't want to offend you

1760
"01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:40,884"
by leaving before the baby's birth.

1761
"01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:43,928"
I'm sorry to hear that Roman isn't well.

1762
"01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:45,513"
He'd be extremely embarrassed

1763
"01:34:45,555 --> 01:34:47,724"
if he knew what you found out.

1764
"01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:50,518"
Suppose we do this.
I'll tell him to leave on Sunday.

1765
"01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,729"
"I'll say I spoke to you,"
and you understand.

1766
"01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:54,939"
Are you sure they'll leave on Sunday?

1767
"01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:55,899"
I'll see to it.

1768
"01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:00,695"
"No matter where we are,"

1769
"01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:01,905"
our thoughts are gonna
be with you every minute

1770
"01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,782"
"till you're all happy and thin again,"

1771
"01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:05,950"
your sweet little boy or girl

1772
"01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,994"
laying safely in your arms.

1773
"01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:09,871"
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

1774
"01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:12,123"
Yeah. You make Guy send us
"lots of pictures, ya hear?"

1775
"01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:13,666"
"Yes, I will."

1776
"01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,418"
"Now, I'm not going to"
"wish you good luck,"

1777
"01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:16,628"
because you won't need it.

1778
"01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:18,880"
You're going to have
"a happy, happy life."

1779
"01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:21,758"
Have a good trip and come back safely.

1780
"01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:25,470"
Perhaps. But I may stay
in Dubrovnik or Pescara

1781
"01:35:25,511 --> 01:35:27,305"
or maybe Majorca.

1782
"01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:29,140"
We shall see.
We shall see.

1783
"01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,683"
Come back.
"Bye, Minnie."

1784
"01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:32,143"
"Yeah, good-bye."

1785
"01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:33,811"
"Good-bye, Roman."
Bye-bye.

1786
"01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:34,646"
Take care now.

1787
"01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,023"
"Kennedy airport, Pan Am building."

1788
"01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:39,651"
Bye!
"Bye, Roman."

1789
"01:35:42,445 --> 01:35:43,821"
"Oh, boy."

1790
"01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:51,329"
Guy?
Hmm?

1791
"01:35:51,371 --> 01:35:53,331"
Where's my book?

1792
"01:35:53,373 --> 01:35:55,667"
"Oh, I put it in the garbage."

1793
"01:35:58,169 --> 01:35:59,420"
What?

1794
"01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:01,798"
I didn't want you upsetting
yourself anymore.

1795
"01:36:01,839 --> 01:36:04,384"
"Guy, Hutch gave me that book."

1796
"01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:05,635"
He left it to me.

1797
"01:36:05,677 --> 01:36:07,053"
I wasn't thinking about that.

1798
"01:36:07,095 --> 01:36:08,680"
That's a terrible thing to do.

1799
"01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:10,223"
I'm sorry. I wasn't
thinking about Hutch.

1800
"01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,857"
"Hey, watch out, lady!"

1801
"01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:18,541"
"In some cults it was believed that
a personal possession of the victim

1802
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:21,794
was necessary and spells cannot be cast"

1803
"01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:24,047"
"without one of the victim's belongings."""

1804
"01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:27,759"
Yeah?
Is this Donald Baumgart?

1805
"01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,928"
That's right.
"This is Rosemary Woodhouse,"

1806
"01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:32,513"
Guy Woodhouse's wife.

1807
"01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:33,848"
"Oh, yes."

1808
"01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:35,683"
I want to know--

1809
"01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:38,019"
"You must be a happy little lady,"

1810
"01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:40,563"
"living in the Bram, rows"
of uniformed lackeys.

1811
"01:37:40,605 --> 01:37:41,773"
"I wanted to know how you are,"

1812
"01:37:41,773 --> 01:37:42,940"
if there's been any improvement.

1813
"01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,609"
"Well, bless your heart."

1814
"01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:48,071"
"Ha, ha, hal"
"Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?"

1815
"01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:51,199"
"Well, I'm splendid."
I only broke six glasses today.

1816
"01:37:53,785 --> 01:37:55,953"
Guy and I are both very unhappy

1817
"01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:59,123"
that he got his break because
of your misfortune.

1818
"01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:04,670"
"Aw, what the hell."

1819
"01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:06,089"
"That's the way it goes, right?"

1820
"01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:10,468"
I'm sorry I didn't come along
that day he came to visit you.

1821
"01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:13,805"
V-Visit?

1822
"01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:16,808"
"Oh, you mean the day we met for drinks?"

1823
"01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:19,227"
"Yes, that's what I meant."

1824
"01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:23,648"
"By the way, he has something"
"of yours, you know."

1825
"01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:24,899"
What do you mean?

1826
"01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:27,151"
Don't you know?

1827
"01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:28,486"
No.

1828
"01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:30,238"
Didn't you miss anything that day?

1829
"01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,117"
"You don't mean my tie, do you?"

1830
"01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:36,494"
Yes.

1831
"01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:39,831"
"Oh, well, he's got mine,"
and I've got his.

1832
"01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:41,457"
He can have it back.

1833
"01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:43,042"
I'm sorry.

1834
"01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:46,671"
Doesn't matter to me now what
color tie I'm wearing.

1835
"01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:48,965"
I didn't understand.
I thought he'd only borrowed it.

1836
"01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:51,509"
"Oh, no."
It was a trade.

1837
"01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:54,345"
Or...

1838
"01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:55,721"
do you think he stole it?

1839
"01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:57,682"
I have to hang up now.

1840
"01:38:57,723 --> 01:39:00,601"
I just wanted to know if there'd
been any improvement.

1841
"01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:02,728"
"No, no, there isn't."

1842
"01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:04,397"
It was nice of you to call. Bye.

1843
"01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:44,187"
"You aren't in labor, are you?"

1844
"01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:46,939"
"No, but I have to see the doctor."
It's very important.

1845
"01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,608"
"But he has to leave at 5:00,"

1846
"01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:50,026"
and there is Mrs. Byron.

1847
"01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:52,403"
I'm sure he'll see you.
Just sit down.

1848
"01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:53,905"
Thank you.

1849
"01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:17,303"
How is it out there?

1850
"01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:19,597"
"Oh, awful. 94."

1851
"01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:21,390"
Ugh!

1852
"01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:22,725"
See you next week.
Make an appointment.

1853
"01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:23,643"
"Yes, I will."

1854
"01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:31,817"
"You're due any day now, aren't you?"

1855
"01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,361"
Tuesday.

1856
"01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:35,196"
You're smart to get it
over with before August.

1857
"01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:38,491"
Mrs. Byron.

1858
"01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:40,618"
He'll see you right after.

1859
"01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:43,120"
"Well, let's see, um..."

1860
"01:40:43,829 --> 01:40:45,206"
July the 10th?

1861
"01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:46,624"
What time?

1862
"01:40:46,666 --> 01:40:48,167"
4:00?
Fine.

1863
"01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:49,502"
All right.
See you then.

1864
"01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:50,711"
Thank you.

1865
"01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:52,088"
Bye-bye.

1866
"01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:54,131"
Good luck.
Thank you.

1867
"01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:03,975"
Mmm! That smells nice.
What is it?

1868
"01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:08,145"
"Oh, my--"
It's called Detchema.

1869
"01:41:09,605 --> 01:41:11,190"
"Well, it's a big improvement"
"on your regular,"

1870
"01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:12,483"
if you don't mind my saying.

1871
"01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:14,569"
That wasn't a perfume.

1872
"01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:16,404"
That was a good luck charm.
I threw it away.

1873
"01:41:16,862 --> 01:41:18,531"
Good.

1874
"01:41:18,573 --> 01:41:20,157"
Maybe the doctor will
follow your example.

1875
"01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,582"
Dr. Sapirstein?

1876
"01:41:27,623 --> 01:41:30,418"
Yes. The aftershave.
"But it isn't, is it?"

1877
"01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:33,254"
I don't think he has a good luck charm.

1878
"01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:35,131"
"Anyway, he has the same"
smell once in a while.

1879
"01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:38,342"
When he does--
"Oh, boy."

1880
"01:41:39,343 --> 01:41:40,553"
Haven't you ever noticed?

1881
"01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:43,222"
No.

1882
"01:41:43,264 --> 01:41:45,725"
"Well, maybe you thought it was"
your own you were smelling.

1883
"01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:47,560"
"What is it, a chemical thing?"

1884
"01:41:49,312 --> 01:41:51,939"
"Will you excuse me a moment, please?"

1885
"01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:53,733"
My husband is waiting outside.

1886
"01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:55,276"
I have to go and tell him something.

1887
"01:41:55,318 --> 01:41:56,694"
I'll be back in a minute.

1888
"01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:46,494"
Dr. Hill's office.

1889
"01:42:46,535 --> 01:42:47,912"
"Dr. Hill, please."

1890
"01:42:47,953 --> 01:42:49,455"
This is his answering service.

1891
"01:42:49,497 --> 01:42:51,582"
Would you like to leave a message?

1892
"01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:55,961"
"Um, yes. My name is Rosemary Woodhouse."

1893
"01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:57,546"
Woodhouse.

1894
"01:42:57,588 --> 01:43:01,092"
And would you ask him to call
"me back right away, please?"

1895
"01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:06,263"
"Uh, my number is 475-2598."

1896
"01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:09,350"
It's an emergency.
I'm in a phone booth.

1897
"01:43:09,392 --> 01:43:10,518"
All right.

1898
"01:43:20,945 --> 01:43:23,155"
"Quickly, please, Dr. Hill, call me."

1899
"01:43:29,954 --> 01:43:31,956"
"Oh, oh, really?"

1900
"01:43:31,997 --> 01:43:33,666"
Did he really say that?

1901
"01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:36,377"
"Oh, he didn't say that."

1902
"01:43:36,419 --> 01:43:39,088"
What else was it that he said?

1903
"01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:41,048"
"Oh, that's wonderful."

1904
"01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:42,758"
That's wonder--
That's marvelous.

1905
"01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:45,344"
Yes. Dr. Hill?

1906
"01:43:45,386 --> 01:43:46,762"
Did I get the name right?

1907
"01:43:46,804 --> 01:43:48,097"
Is it Rosemary Woodhouse?

1908
"01:43:48,139 --> 01:43:50,433"
Yes.
Are you Dr. Hill's patient?

1909
"01:43:50,766 --> 01:43:52,601"
No.

1910
"01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:55,563"
"Um, yes, I mean, well,"
I've seen him once.

1911
"01:43:55,604 --> 01:43:58,524"
"Um, please, please tell him"
he has to speak to me.

1912
"01:43:58,566 --> 01:43:59,984"
It's important.

1913
"01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:01,777"
"Tell him to call me, hmm?"

1914
"01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:03,487"
All right.
Thank you.

1915
"01:44:10,703 --> 01:44:14,081"
All of them.
All of them.

1916
"01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:17,001"
All in it together.
All of them.

1917
"01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:18,586"
All of them witches.

1918
"01:44:20,171 --> 01:44:21,756"
"Don't you worry, little Andy or Jenny,"

1919
"01:44:21,797 --> 01:44:23,841"
I'll kill them before
I let them touch you.

1920
"01:44:29,096 --> 01:44:30,681"
Yes. Dr--

1921
"01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:32,308"
Mrs. Woodhouse?
Yes!

1922
"01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:35,102"
"Oh, thank you, thank you for calling me."

1923
"01:44:35,144 --> 01:44:36,562"
Thought you were in California.

1924
"01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:40,816"
"No. No, I've been to another doctor,"

1925
"01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:42,943"
"and he isn't good, Dr. Hill."

1926
"01:44:42,985 --> 01:44:44,570"
He's been lying to me

1927
"01:44:44,612 --> 01:44:47,907"
and giving me unusual kinds
of drinks and capsules.

1928
"01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:50,451"
The baby's due on Tuesday.

1929
"01:44:50,493 --> 01:44:52,369"
Remember you told me June 28th?

1930
"01:44:52,411 --> 01:44:53,746"
"Well, I want you to deliver it."

1931
"01:44:53,788 --> 01:44:55,039"
Mrs. Woodhouse--

1932
"01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:58,125"
Please let me talk to you.

1933
"01:44:58,167 --> 01:45:00,711"
Let me come and explain
what's been going on.

1934
"01:45:00,753 --> 01:45:02,505"
I can't stay too long here.

1935
"01:45:02,546 --> 01:45:04,840"
"They'll be coming, looking for me."

1936
"01:45:04,882 --> 01:45:06,300"
Dr. Hill?

1937
"01:45:06,342 --> 01:45:07,718"
"Dr. Hill, there's a plot--"

1938
"01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:10,137"
I know that sounds crazy.

1939
"01:45:10,179 --> 01:45:11,430"
"You're probably thinking,"

1940
"01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:13,557"
"My God, this poor girl
has really flipped,"

1941
"01:45:13,557 --> 01:45:16,560"
"but I haven't flipped,"
"Dr. Hill, I swear."

1942
"01:45:16,602 --> 01:45:18,562"
"By all the saints, I haven't."

1943
"01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:21,148"
There are plots against
"people, aren't there?"

1944
"01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:23,150"
"Yes, I suppose there are."

1945
"01:45:23,192 --> 01:45:25,736"
"Well, then there's one"
against me and my baby.

1946
"01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:29,907"
Come to my office tomorrow after 5:00.

1947
"01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:31,617"
Now! Right now.

1948
"01:45:32,743 --> 01:45:35,120"
"Mrs. Woodhouse, I'm"
not at my office now.

1949
"01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:36,664"
I'm home. I've been up
since yesterday morning.

1950
"01:45:36,705 --> 01:45:37,832"
I beg you.

1951
"01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:39,625"
I beg you.

1952
"01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:42,294"
I can't stay here.

1953
"01:45:44,213 --> 01:45:45,297"
My office at 8:00.

1954
"01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:47,091"
"Yes, thank you."

1955
"01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:48,551"
"Oh, wait! Dr. Hill?"

1956
"01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:49,969"
Yes?

1957
"01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:51,929"
"My husband may call you, asking--"

1958
"01:45:51,971 --> 01:45:53,681"
I'm not gonna speak to anyone.

1959
"01:45:53,722 --> 01:45:55,599"
I'm gonna take a nap.
Thank you.

1960
"01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,719"
Keep the change.

1961
"01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,637"
"Uh, driver, please,"

1962
"01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:36,223"
could you wait and watch until--

1963
"01:46:36,265 --> 01:46:37,975"
Until I'm inside the door?

1964
"01:46:54,283 --> 01:46:55,659"
He lied to you.

1965
"01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:57,786"
He said we were going to Hollywood.

1966
"01:46:57,828 --> 01:46:59,997"
"The worst thing of all, he's"
involved with them as well.

1967
"01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:02,207"
He sleeps in pajamas now.

1968
"01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:04,209"
He never used to before.

1969
"01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:05,794"
He's probably hiding a mark.

1970
"01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:08,005"
You know they give you
marks when you join--

1971
"01:47:08,047 --> 01:47:09,506"
All sorts of rituals.

1972
"01:47:09,548 --> 01:47:11,550"
They hold Sabbaths there.

1973
"01:47:11,592 --> 01:47:13,636"
You could hear them singing
through the wall.

1974
"01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:16,555"
"Guy, my husband Guy said"
"it was Dr. Shand,"

1975
"01:47:16,597 --> 01:47:18,349"
one of these people playing a recorder.

1976
"01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:21,393"
"Now, how did he know it was Dr. Shand"

1977
"01:47:21,435 --> 01:47:22,728"
unless he was there with them?

1978
"01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:26,941"
"Um, they're very clever people."

1979
"01:47:26,982 --> 01:47:29,360"
They planned everything
right from the beginning.

1980
"01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:32,613"
They probably made some
sort of deal with Guy.

1981
"01:47:32,655 --> 01:47:35,532"
"They gave him success, and"
he promised them our baby

1982
"01:47:35,574 --> 01:47:37,493"
to use in their rituals.

1983
"01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:40,204"
"I know this sounds crazy,"

1984
"01:47:40,204 --> 01:47:43,082"
but I've-- I've got books here. Look.

1985
"01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:48,379"
There was another actor like
"him, Donald Baumgart,"

1986
"01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:50,547"
and they put a spell on him.

1987
"01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:52,549"
They cast a spell on him
and made him blind

1988
"01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:53,884"
so that Guy could get his part.

1989
"01:47:54,885 --> 01:47:55,886"
"Look, here."

1990
"01:47:58,806 --> 01:48:00,724"
I had this friend Edward Hutchins.

1991
"01:48:00,766 --> 01:48:02,726"
"Maybe you heard of him, a writer."

1992
"01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,478"
He wrote stories for boys.

1993
"01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,063"
"Anyway, he was my good friend"

1994
"01:48:06,063 --> 01:48:07,314"
since I first came to New York.

1995
"01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:08,649"
May I keep this?

1996
"01:48:08,691 --> 01:48:12,361"
"Yes, please, and, look, anyway,"

1997
"01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:14,655"
once Mr. Hutchins came to visit me--

1998
"01:48:16,156 --> 01:48:17,449"
Came to visit me.

1999
"01:48:17,449 --> 01:48:19,994"
It was the time I was having
"this pain, Doctor."

2000
"01:48:20,035 --> 01:48:21,203"
I was suffering so--

2001
"01:48:21,203 --> 01:48:23,539"
You can't imagine how
"much I was suffering,"

2002
"01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,916"
and they wouldn't help me. Nobody would.

2003
"01:48:25,958 --> 01:48:28,836"
They were giving me a drink
with tannis root in it.

2004
"01:48:28,877 --> 01:48:32,047"
"Also witches' stuff, tannis root."

2005
"01:48:32,089 --> 01:48:35,634"
"Hutch came, and he immediately"
saw something was wrong.

2006
"01:48:35,676 --> 01:48:37,511"
"He-- He knew about witches, you see."

2007
"01:48:37,553 --> 01:48:40,514"
"Suddenly, Guy rushed in"
"with his makeup still on,"

2008
"01:48:40,556 --> 01:48:41,765"
which he never did.

2009
"01:48:41,807 --> 01:48:44,393"
They probably called him to come home

2010
"01:48:44,435 --> 01:48:46,061"
"and steal one of Hutch's belongings,"

2011
"01:48:46,103 --> 01:48:47,855"
which he did.
"Took his glove,"

2012
"01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:50,107"
"and they put a spell on him, too."

2013
"01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:52,818"
Put him in a coma.
"Three months later, he died."

2014
"01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:57,281"
"Now, maybe all of this is coincidence,"

2015
"01:48:57,281 --> 01:48:58,532"
but one thing is for sure.

2016
"01:48:58,574 --> 01:49:00,451"
"They have a coven, and"
they want my baby.

2017
"01:49:04,163 --> 01:49:05,581"
Certainly seems that way.

2018
"01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:18,635"
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

2019
"01:49:18,635 --> 01:49:20,345"
"I don't believe in witchcraft,"

2020
"01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:22,806"
but there are plenty of maniacs
and crazy people in this city.

2021
"01:49:24,266 --> 01:49:25,684"
"The doctor's name is Shand, you say?"

2022
"01:49:25,726 --> 01:49:29,146"
"N-No, Dr. Shand is one of these people."

2023
"01:49:29,188 --> 01:49:30,689"
The doctor's name is Sapirstein.

2024
"01:49:32,274 --> 01:49:33,525"
Abraham Sapirstein?

2025
"01:49:34,151 --> 01:49:35,486"
Yeah.

2026
"01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:38,280"
Do you know him?

2027
"01:49:38,322 --> 01:49:39,823"
I've met him once or twice.

2028
"01:49:40,699 --> 01:49:42,576"
"To look at him, you'd never think he--"

2029
"01:49:42,618 --> 01:49:44,495"
"No, you wouldn't."
Not in a million years.

2030
"01:49:45,871 --> 01:49:47,998"
Would you like to go into
"Mount Sinai right now,"

2031
"01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:48,999"
this evening?

2032
"01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,295"
"Yeah, I would love to."
Would that be possible?

2033
"01:49:53,337 --> 01:49:54,838"
"It's difficult, but we'll try."

2034
"01:49:56,423 --> 01:49:57,841"
I want you to lie down
and get some rest.

2035
"01:49:57,883 --> 01:50:00,177"
Thanks.

2036
"01:50:00,177 --> 01:50:03,514"
"Anything they've got, even"
a broom closet'd be fine.

2037
"01:50:03,514 --> 01:50:05,015"
I hope we can do better than that.

2038
"01:50:11,939 --> 01:50:14,024"
"I'll see what I can do,"
then I'll check you over.

2039
"01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:19,822"
"Oh, should I undress now?"

2040
"01:50:19,863 --> 01:50:21,740"
No. It'll take me about a half
an hour on the telephone.

2041
"01:50:21,782 --> 01:50:22,908"
"You just lie down, rest."

2042
"01:50:25,702 --> 01:50:26,829"
Okay?

2043
"01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:27,913"
Okay.

2044
"01:50:36,588 --> 01:50:38,507"
God bless Dr. Hill.

2045
"01:50:45,055 --> 01:50:47,641"
Everything's going to be
"okay, now, Andy or Jenny."

2046
"01:50:48,725 --> 01:50:51,562"
We're going to be in
"a nice, clean hospital"

2047
"01:50:51,603 --> 01:50:53,188"
with no visitors.

2048
"01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:57,693"
Oh.

2049
"01:51:15,085 --> 01:51:16,170"
Monsters.

2050
"01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:20,757"
Monsters.

2051
"01:51:24,261 --> 01:51:25,804"
Unspeakable.

2052
"01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:28,098"
Unspeakable.

2053
"01:52:00,464 --> 01:52:01,882"
I was sleeping.

2054
"01:52:16,813 --> 01:52:18,941"
"Come with us quietly, Rosemary."

2055
"01:52:18,982 --> 01:52:21,151"
Don't argue or make a scene

2056
"01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:23,820"
because if you say anything more
"about witches or witchcraft,"

2057
"01:52:23,862 --> 01:52:26,281"
we're going to be forced to take
you to a mental hospital.

2058
"01:52:26,323 --> 01:52:27,491"
"You don't want that, do you?"

2059
"01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:29,660"
So put your shoes on.

2060
"01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:31,662"
We just want to take you home.

2061
"01:52:31,703 --> 01:52:32,996"
No one's going to hurt you.

2062
"01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:34,790"
Or the baby.
Put your shoes on.

2063
"01:52:54,351 --> 01:52:56,019"
She's fine now.

2064
"01:52:56,061 --> 01:52:58,272"
We're going to go home and rest.

2065
"01:52:58,313 --> 01:52:59,690"
That's all it takes.

2066
"01:52:59,690 --> 01:53:01,441"
"Thank you for your trouble, Doctor."

2067
"01:53:01,483 --> 01:53:02,943"
"Glad I could be of help, sir."

2068
"01:53:02,985 --> 01:53:04,861"
It's a shame you had to
come in here.

2069
"01:53:58,415 --> 01:53:59,166"
"Good evening, Mrs. Woodhouse."

2070
"01:54:15,307 --> 01:54:16,433"
Mrs. Woodhouse!

2071
"01:54:17,893 --> 01:54:19,269"
Mrs. Woodhouse!

2072
"01:54:44,961 --> 01:54:45,962"
Uhh!

2073
"01:55:23,708 --> 01:55:25,001"
Ro!

2074
"01:55:25,043 --> 01:55:28,797"
Ro! Ro!

2075
"01:55:28,839 --> 01:55:30,340"
"Ro, baby, Ro!"

2076
"01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:32,467"
Ro!

2077
"01:55:36,012 --> 01:55:38,014"
"Come on, open up, Ro."
Go to hell!

2078
"01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:39,099"
"Come on, honey."
No one's going to hurt you.

2079
"01:55:39,141 --> 01:55:42,018"
"You promised them the baby, get out!"

2080
"01:55:42,018 --> 01:55:43,228"
"No, I didn't promise them anything."

2081
"01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:44,312"
What are you talking about?
Promised who?

2082
"01:55:44,354 --> 01:55:45,522"
"Rosemary, you're--"

2083
"01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:20,223"
Hello.
Elise.

2084
"01:56:20,265 --> 01:56:22,767"
Mrs. Dunstan is out.
Who is this?

2085
"01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:24,561"
The babysitter.
Do you know where she went?

2086
"01:56:24,603 --> 01:56:26,354"
They went to the movies.

2087
"01:56:26,396 --> 01:56:29,191"
This is Rosemary.
Please ask her to call Rosemary

2088
"01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:30,942"
the second she gets home.

2089
"01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:34,154"
It's terribly urgent. Don't--
Don't forget.

2090
"01:56:34,196 --> 01:56:35,489"
Don't worry.
I'll tell her.

2091
"01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:36,448"
Thank you.

2092
"01:56:43,663 --> 01:56:45,040"
"We don't want to hurt you, Ro."

2093
"01:56:46,249 --> 01:56:48,418"
"We're your friends, Rosemary."

2094
"01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:50,629"
There's nothing to be
"afraid of, Rosemary."

2095
"01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:52,255"
Honest and truly there isn't.

2096
"01:56:52,255 --> 01:56:54,799"
This is nothing but a mild
sedative to calm you down.

2097
"01:56:54,841 --> 01:56:55,759"
You know I wouldn't let any--

2098
"01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:58,261"
Ro.

2099
"01:56:58,261 --> 01:56:59,387"
Aah!

2100
"01:56:59,429 --> 01:57:00,889"
"Ro, Ro!"

2101
"01:57:00,931 --> 01:57:03,350"
Help me!
"Oh, Ro, baby."

2102
"01:57:03,391 --> 01:57:05,644"
"Somebody, help me!"

2103
"01:57:05,685 --> 01:57:08,188"
Aah!

2104
"01:57:17,197 --> 01:57:18,240"
Wait a minute.

2105
"01:57:18,782 --> 01:57:20,492"
Wait a minute now.

2106
"01:57:26,331 --> 01:57:27,874"
We happen to be in labor here.

2107
"01:57:27,916 --> 01:57:29,167"
Here?

2108
"01:57:29,209 --> 01:57:31,628"
Here.
"You're all right, baby."

2109
"01:57:31,670 --> 01:57:34,256"
You're gonna be perfectly all right.
I swear to God you will.

2110
"01:57:34,297 --> 01:57:36,299"
There were supposed to
"be doctors, hospitals!"

2111
"01:57:36,341 --> 01:57:39,469"
"Doctors, hospitals!"

2112
"01:57:39,469 --> 01:57:41,388"
Everything-- Everything's
clean and sterile!

2113
"01:57:42,556 --> 01:57:44,808"
"No, she isn't here, Elise."

2114
"01:57:44,808 --> 01:57:45,976"
I'll have her call you back.

2115
"01:57:51,898 --> 01:57:53,692"
"Oh, Andy..."

2116
"01:57:53,733 --> 01:57:55,318"
Andy or Jenny...

2117
"01:57:56,278 --> 01:57:59,281"
"I-I'm sorry, my little darling."

2118
"01:58:00,657 --> 01:58:01,992"
Forgive me!

2119
"01:58:13,503 --> 01:58:14,588"
Hi.

2120
"01:58:20,343 --> 01:58:21,678"
Hi.

2121
"01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:25,557"
Is it all right?

2122
"01:58:27,017 --> 01:58:29,311"
"Yes, it's fine."

2123
"01:58:32,355 --> 01:58:33,440"
What is it?

2124
"01:58:34,399 --> 01:58:35,442"
A boy.

2125
"01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:42,449"
Really? A boy.

2126
"01:58:52,792 --> 01:58:54,085"
And it's all right?

2127
"01:58:54,669 --> 01:58:55,712"
Yes.

2128
"01:59:15,649 --> 01:59:16,816"
Where is it?

2129
"01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:20,570"
"Ohh! Oh, my goodness."

2130
"01:59:20,570 --> 01:59:23,323"
"Oh, gee, what a start you"
gave me. My goodness.

2131
"01:59:23,365 --> 01:59:25,325"
"The baby, where is it?"

2132
"01:59:25,367 --> 01:59:28,411"
"Oh, uh, you wait here one minute."

2133
"01:59:30,789 --> 01:59:31,998"
Where's my baby?

2134
"01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:34,834"
"Uh, I'll go find Dr. Abe."

2135
"01:59:34,876 --> 01:59:36,336"
Ju-Just wait.

2136
"01:59:52,811 --> 01:59:53,687"
Where's the baby?

2137
"01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:58,608"
Where is it?

2138
"01:59:59,359 --> 02:00:00,402"
Honey--

2139
"02:00:01,945 --> 02:00:03,613"
"There were complications,"
"Rosemary,"

2140
"02:00:03,655 --> 02:00:05,240"
but nothing that will
affect future births.

2141
"02:00:08,868 --> 02:00:10,120"
It's--

2142
"02:00:12,038 --> 02:00:13,748"
Dead.

2143
"02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:15,041"
It was in the wrong position.

2144
"02:00:15,083 --> 02:00:17,001"
In the hospital I might have been
"able to do something about it,"

2145
"02:00:17,043 --> 02:00:18,294"
but you wouldn't listen.

2146
"02:00:18,336 --> 02:00:19,754"
"Honey, we can have others"
as soon as you're better.

2147
"02:00:19,796 --> 02:00:21,047"
I promise you.

2148
"02:00:21,089 --> 02:00:21,840"
Absolutely.

2149
"02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:23,299"
You can start on another
in a very few months.

2150
"02:00:23,299 --> 02:00:24,843"
As soon as you're better.

2151
"02:00:24,884 --> 02:00:26,136"
No.

2152
"02:00:27,554 --> 02:00:29,597"
I don't believe you.
You're both lying.

2153
"02:00:29,639 --> 02:00:32,142"
You're lying!
It didn't die!

2154
"02:00:32,142 --> 02:00:33,351"
You took it!

2155
"02:00:33,393 --> 02:00:36,229"
You're lying!
You're witches!

2156
"02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:37,647"
You're lying!

2157
"02:00:37,647 --> 02:00:42,318"
You're lying! You're lying!
You're lying!

2158
"02:00:51,327 --> 02:00:55,165"
Abe says it's called prepartum.

2159
"02:00:55,165 --> 02:00:57,333"
I don't know.
It's some kind of a hysteria.

2160
"02:00:58,668 --> 02:01:01,504"
"Boy, you were really kapow,"
out of your mind.

2161
"02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:09,345"
"Uh, I know where you got the idea"
"that Minnie and Roman were witches,"

2162
"02:01:11,514 --> 02:01:13,850"
"but, um, how come you thought that"
Abe and I joined the party?

2163
"02:01:18,146 --> 02:01:21,107"
"Um, let's face it, darling."

2164
"02:01:21,149 --> 02:01:24,360"
You had the prepartum crazies.

2165
"02:01:25,945 --> 02:01:28,364"
"Now you're going to rest, and"
you're going to get over them.

2166
"02:01:30,784 --> 02:01:33,870"
I know this is the worst thing
"that ever happened to you,"

2167
"02:01:33,912 --> 02:01:36,581"
"but from now on, everything's"
going to be roses.

2168
"02:01:36,623 --> 02:01:38,625"
Paramount's within an inch
"of where we want them,"

2169
"02:01:38,666 --> 02:01:40,960"
and suddenly Universal's
"interested, too,"

2170
"02:01:41,002 --> 02:01:42,462"
"and we're going to blow this town,"

2171
"02:01:42,504 --> 02:01:44,714"
and we're going to be in the
beautiful hills of Beverly

2172
"02:01:44,756 --> 02:01:48,009"
"with a pool, a spice garden,"
"the whole schmeer,"

2173
"02:01:48,051 --> 02:01:50,053"
"and the kids, too, Ro."

2174
"02:01:50,094 --> 02:01:52,222"
Scout's honor.
You heard what Abe said.

2175
"02:01:56,226 --> 02:01:58,520"
"Now, I got to run now and get famous."

2176
"02:02:02,065 --> 02:02:03,900"
Let me see your shoulder.

2177
"02:02:07,362 --> 02:02:08,780"
Let me see your shoulder.

2178
"02:02:09,697 --> 02:02:11,074"
Are you kidding?

2179
"02:02:11,074 --> 02:02:12,408"
Your left shoulder.

2180
"02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:15,537"
All right.
Anything you say.

2181
"02:02:19,457 --> 02:02:20,917"
I generally prefer doing this to music.

2182
"02:02:22,335 --> 02:02:23,670"
Left shoulder.

2183
"02:02:26,714 --> 02:02:27,799"
Right shoulder.

2184
"02:02:31,594 --> 02:02:33,555"
And that's as far as I go
without a blue light.

2185
"02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:41,729"
The high pressure area that we see here

2186
"02:02:41,771 --> 02:02:43,439"
has been causing this extreme
heat and humidity.

2187
"02:02:44,274 --> 02:02:47,318"
And unfortunately will be staying
with us city dwellers

2188
"02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:48,862"
through the rest of the week.

2189
"02:02:48,903 --> 02:02:52,282"
It will be hot and overcast
upstate New York as well

2190
"02:02:52,282 --> 02:02:55,785"
with the possibility of thunder
showers tonight and tomorrow

2191
"02:02:55,827 --> 02:02:58,788"
with gradual clearing by tomorrow night.

2192
"02:02:58,830 --> 02:03:02,083"
All you people leaving the city this
upcoming weekend should find it hot.

2193
"02:03:26,441 --> 02:03:28,610"
Do you hear a baby crying?

2194
"02:03:29,819 --> 02:03:32,363"
"Why, no, I don't, dear."

2195
"02:03:32,405 --> 02:03:34,324"
"Now, you come and get into your bed now."

2196
"02:03:34,365 --> 02:03:35,617"
It's time for you to take your pill.

2197
"02:03:46,502 --> 02:03:49,255"
Did you turn the air conditioner off?
Mm-hmm.

2198
"02:03:49,297 --> 02:03:51,424"
"Well, you mustn't do that, dear."

2199
"02:03:51,466 --> 02:03:53,885"
"Why, people are actually"
"dying, it's so hot."

2200
"02:04:09,651 --> 02:04:11,361"
What do you do with the milk?

2201
"02:04:11,402 --> 02:04:14,364"
"Why, uh, throw it away."

2202
"02:04:14,364 --> 02:04:15,657"
"Your pill, Rosemary."

2203
"02:04:23,456 --> 02:04:26,042"
"Hello, girls."

2204
"02:04:26,918 --> 02:04:29,379"
Whew. 95 out.

2205
"02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:32,382"
Some new people moved on in up in 8.

2206
"02:04:34,008 --> 02:04:35,468"
Do they have a baby?

2207
"02:04:37,929 --> 02:04:38,930"
How'd you know that?

2208
"02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:42,100"
I heard it crying.

2209
"02:04:43,226 --> 02:04:44,394"
"Oh, wait a minute."

2210
"02:04:48,481 --> 02:04:51,609"
"Oh, no."
Don't do that.

2211
"02:04:51,651 --> 02:04:53,236"
Why not?

2212
"02:04:53,236 --> 02:04:56,030"
"Uh, a little messy, that's all."

2213
"02:07:46,534 --> 02:07:47,994"
"Easy, easy."

2214
"02:08:05,970 --> 02:08:07,930"
Got her too high.

2215
"02:08:28,117 --> 02:08:30,953"
Not if he's still waiting
"for a plane, he isn't."

2216
"02:08:33,414 --> 02:08:35,833"
"Oh, hell, now, Hayato."

2217
"02:08:35,875 --> 02:08:37,376"
You're just making fun of me.

2218
"02:08:37,418 --> 02:08:39,045"
"You're pulling my leg, like we say."

2219
"02:09:05,446 --> 02:09:06,989"
Aah!

2220
"02:09:08,908 --> 02:09:11,285"
"Rosemary, go back to bed."

2221
"02:09:11,327 --> 02:09:13,496"
You know you're not supposed
to be up and around.

2222
"02:09:13,496 --> 02:09:15,831"
Is the mother?
"Uh, Rosemary--"

2223
"02:09:15,873 --> 02:09:18,084"
Shut up.
You're in Dubrovnik.

2224
"02:09:18,084 --> 02:09:19,168"
I don't hear you.

2225
"02:10:04,297 --> 02:10:05,715"
What have you done to it?

2226
"02:10:06,924 --> 02:10:08,884"
What have you done to its eyes?

2227
"02:10:08,884 --> 02:10:10,720"
He has his father's eyes.

2228
"02:10:16,392 --> 02:10:17,560"
What are you talking about?

2229
"02:10:17,601 --> 02:10:19,228"
Guy's eyes are normal.

2230
"02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:23,065"
"What have you done to him,"
you maniacs?

2231
"02:10:23,065 --> 02:10:25,985"
"Satan is his father, not Guy."

2232
"02:10:26,027 --> 02:10:29,530"
He came up from hell and begat
a son of mortal woman.

2233
"02:10:29,572 --> 02:10:30,573"
"Hail, Satan!"

2234
"02:10:30,614 --> 02:10:31,991"
"Hail, Satan!"

2235
"02:10:32,033 --> 02:10:35,911"
"Satan is his father, and"
his name is Adrian.

2236
"02:10:35,911 --> 02:10:38,831"
He shall overthrow the mighty
and lay waste their temples.

2237
"02:10:38,873 --> 02:10:42,668"
He shall redeem the despised
and wreak vengeance

2238
"02:10:42,710 --> 02:10:45,254"
in the name of the burned
and the tortured!

2239
"02:10:45,296 --> 02:10:46,630"
"Hail, Adrian!"

2240
"02:10:46,672 --> 02:10:47,757"
"Hail, Adrian!"

2241
"02:10:47,798 --> 02:10:49,508"
"Hail, Satan!"
"Hail, Satan!"

2242
"02:10:49,550 --> 02:10:50,801"
"Hail, Satan!"

2243
"02:10:50,843 --> 02:10:53,888"
He chose you out of all the world.

2244
"02:10:53,929 --> 02:10:55,973"
Out of all the women in the
"whole world, he chose you."

2245
"02:10:56,015 --> 02:10:57,725"
He arranged things because he wanted you

2246
"02:10:57,767 --> 02:10:59,268"
to be the mother of his only living son.

2247
"02:10:59,268 --> 02:11:01,604"
His power is stronger than stronger!

2248
"02:11:01,604 --> 02:11:04,273"
His might shall last longer than longer!

2249
"02:11:04,315 --> 02:11:05,733"
"Hail, Satan!"

2250
"02:11:06,525 --> 02:11:08,319"
No!

2251
"02:11:08,361 --> 02:11:10,738"
It can't be!

2252
"02:11:11,322 --> 02:11:12,948"
No!

2253
"02:11:12,948 --> 02:11:14,283"
Go look at his hands.

2254
"02:11:14,325 --> 02:11:15,326"
And his feet.

2255
"02:11:17,703 --> 02:11:20,081"
"Oh, God!"

2256
"02:11:21,749 --> 02:11:25,461"
God is dead!
Satan lives!

2257
"02:11:25,503 --> 02:11:26,796"
The year is one!

2258
"02:11:26,837 --> 02:11:28,506"
"Hail, Satan!"
"Hail, Satan!"

2259
"02:11:28,547 --> 02:11:30,299"
"The year is one, and God is done!"

2260
"02:11:30,299 --> 02:11:31,592"
"Oh, God!"

2261
"02:11:31,634 --> 02:11:32,885"
The year is one!

2262
"02:11:32,927 --> 02:11:36,305"
"Hail, Adrian!"

2263
"02:11:36,305 --> 02:11:38,057"
"Hail, Satan!"

2264
"02:11:38,099 --> 02:11:40,810"
"Why don't you help us out,"
Rosemary?

2265
"02:11:40,851 --> 02:11:42,978"
Be a real mother to Adrian.

2266
"02:11:42,978 --> 02:11:44,814"
You don't have to join
if you don't want to.

2267
"02:11:44,855 --> 02:11:46,982"
Just be a mother to your baby.

2268
"02:11:48,901 --> 02:11:51,946"
Minnie and Laura-Louise are too old.

2269
"02:11:52,613 --> 02:11:53,948"
It's not right.

2270
"02:11:56,784 --> 02:11:57,952"
"Think about it, Rosemary."

2271
"02:12:11,465 --> 02:12:13,509"
"Oh, God!"

2272
"02:12:13,509 --> 02:12:14,885"
"Oh, shut up with your ""Oh, Gods,"""

2273
"02:12:14,927 --> 02:12:16,220"
"or we'll kill you, milk or no milk."

2274
"02:12:16,262 --> 02:12:17,471"
You shut up.

2275
"02:12:17,513 --> 02:12:19,515"
"Rosemary's his mother, so"
you show some respect.

2276
"02:12:22,852 --> 02:12:24,687"
"Come, my friend."

2277
"02:12:24,687 --> 02:12:27,022"
Come see him.
Come see the child.

2278
"02:12:37,408 --> 02:12:39,368"
What would you like to drink?

2279
"02:12:40,453 --> 02:12:42,705"
"They, uh, promised me"
"you wouldn't be hurt,"

2280
"02:12:42,705 --> 02:12:44,832"
"and you haven't been, really."

2281
"02:12:46,709 --> 02:12:49,044"
"I mean, supposing you had"
"the baby, and you lost it."

2282
"02:12:50,754 --> 02:12:52,131"
Wouldn't that be the same?

2283
"02:12:53,257 --> 02:12:54,925"
And we're getting so much
"in return, Ro."

2284
"02:13:06,437 --> 02:13:10,274"
"Oh, Guy, let me introduce you"
to Argyron Stavropoulos.

2285
"02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:13,068"
How proud you must be.

2286
"02:13:13,068 --> 02:13:14,987"
Is this the mother?

2287
"02:13:15,029 --> 02:13:16,572"
Why in the name of--

2288
"02:13:16,614 --> 02:13:18,574"
"Here, drink this."
You'll feel a little better.

2289
"02:13:18,616 --> 02:13:19,909"
What's in it?
Tannis root?

2290
"02:13:19,950 --> 02:13:21,327"
Nothing's in it.

2291
"02:13:21,368 --> 02:13:23,579"
"Just plain, ordinary Lipton's"
tea. You drink it.

2292
"02:13:55,861 --> 02:13:58,239"
Get away from here.
Roman.

2293
"02:13:58,280 --> 02:14:00,699"
You're rocking him too fast.

2294
"02:14:00,741 --> 02:14:02,785"
Sit down. Get her out of here.

2295
"02:14:02,826 --> 02:14:03,953"
Put her where she belongs.

2296
"02:14:03,994 --> 02:14:05,454"
You're rocking him too fast.

2297
"02:14:05,496 --> 02:14:06,705"
That's why he's crying.

2298
"02:14:06,747 --> 02:14:07,790"
"Oh, mind your own business."

2299
"02:14:07,790 --> 02:14:09,667"
Let Rosemary rock him.

2300
"02:14:09,708 --> 02:14:10,918"
"Go on, sit down with the others."

2301
"02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,127"
Let Rosemary rock him.

2302
"02:14:12,127 --> 02:14:13,295"
"Well, she's liable to--"

2303
"02:14:13,295 --> 02:14:15,422"
"Sit down with the others,"
Laura-Louise.

2304
"02:14:25,724 --> 02:14:27,101"
Rock him.

2305
"02:14:29,895 --> 02:14:31,647"
You're trying to get me
to be his mother.

2306
"02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:35,192"
Aren't you his mother?
