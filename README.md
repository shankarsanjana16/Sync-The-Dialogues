A Brief Description & Prerequisites:

- This project was made entirely on google colab, and is notebook-friendly.
- You can try this code with different subtitle files and movie videos.
- The code requires the subtitle files (.srt) to be converted to a more panda-friendly extension (.csv).
- The code also outputs a file extension of .csv, which must be later converted to .srt, to make it video-friendly.
