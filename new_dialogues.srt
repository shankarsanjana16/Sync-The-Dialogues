1
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:42,726
Are you a doctor?
2
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:43,852
Yes. Yes.
3
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:45,062
He's an actor.
4
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:46,897
Oh, an actor.
5
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:48,732
We're very popular with actors.
6
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:50,525
Have I, uh, seen you in anything?
7
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:53,528
Let's see. I did Hamlet a
while back, didn't I, Liz?
8
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,073
And then we did, the, uh,
The Sandpiper.
9
00:02:56,114 --> 00:02:58,033
He's joking.
He was in Luther
10
00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,743
and Nobody Loves an Albatross
11
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:02,245
and a lot of television
plays and commercials.
12
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:04,081
Well, that's where the money
is, isn't it? Commercials.
13
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:05,791
And the artistic thrills, too.
14
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:14,383
7, Diego.
15
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:16,259
Originally, the smallest
apartment was a 9.
16
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:18,637
They've been broken up into
four, fives, and sixes.
17
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:21,223
Now, 7-E is a four,
18
00:03:21,264 --> 00:03:23,558
originally the back part of a 10.
19
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,519
It has the original dining
room for its living room,
20
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,604
another bedroom for the bedroom,
21
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,272
and two servants' rooms
thrown together
22
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,108
for a dining room or a second bedroom.
23
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,110
Do you have children?
24
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:35,153
Uh, we plan to.
25
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,657
We must oil that gate,
Diego.
26
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:42,828
This way, please.
27
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,921
The previous tenant, Mrs. Gardenia,
28
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:54,965
passed away just a few days ago,
29
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:56,800
So nothing has been moved yet.
30
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,010
Her son asked me to say that
some of the furniture
31
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:01,221
could be picked up practically
for the asking.
32
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:03,098
Did she die in the apartment?
33
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,349
Not that it makes any difference.
34
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,309
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
In a hospital.
35
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:08,603
She'd been in a coma for weeks.
36
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:09,813
After you, please.
37
00:04:09,813 --> 00:04:11,106
Thank you.
38
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,067
She was very old
39
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,528
and passed away without ever waking.
40
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,697
I'd be grateful to go that way
myself when the time comes.
41
00:04:20,824 --> 00:04:23,243
Oh, no, no, no, not
in the apartment, no.
42
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:27,372
She was chipper right to the end,
43
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:29,458
been one of the first women
lawyers in New York state.
44
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:31,334
Did a little gardening on
the side, too.
45
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:32,878
She was quite a woman.
46
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,171
Oh, closet.
47
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:36,423
Oh, plenty of closets.
48
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:40,218
Oh, nice view of the park.
49
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,344
Oh, very nice view.
50
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:42,971
Yeah.
51
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:44,139
Now, this room, for instance,
52
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:46,224
it would make a lovely nursery.
53
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:47,976
Yes. Yellow and white wallpaper
54
00:04:48,018 --> 00:04:49,895
would brighten it tremendously.
55
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:51,521
What are all these things here?
56
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:53,356
Herbs, mostly.
57
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:54,733
A nice large bathroom.
58
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,693
Mmm. Mint, basil.
59
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:58,487
Yeah.
No marijuana?
60
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:01,156
Come on.
61
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:08,830
The, uh, master bedroom.
62
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:10,457
Oh, yes.
63
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:11,833
Here we are, back at the hallway again.
64
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,336
There.
65
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:17,005
Oh.
66
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:18,131
Oh, Guy!
67
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:19,424
Yeah.
68
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,592
Ohh!
69
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:21,635
The fireplace works,
of course.
70
00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:22,719
Great.
71
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:24,805
Ohl
72
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,933
Oh, it's a wonderful apartment.
I love it!
73
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:29,476
See what she's trying to do?
74
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:31,144
She's trying to get you
to lower the rent, see?
75
00:05:31,186 --> 00:05:33,438
Yes.
Well, we'd raise it if we were allowed.
76
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,190
Apartments with this kind of charm--
77
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:40,403
Why, that's odd.
78
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:47,244
There's a closet behind that secretary.
79
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:50,247
I'm su--
I'm sure there is.
80
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:51,915
Yeah. Oh, I think you're right.
81
00:05:56,253 --> 00:05:57,921
She moved it.
It used to be there.
82
00:06:04,594 --> 00:06:06,263
Ohh! Give me a hand, will you?
83
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:31,872
I see now why she went into a coma.
84
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:34,124
Ha, ha, hal
85
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:35,542
She couldn't have lifted it by herself.
86
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:37,043
She was 89.
87
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:38,420
Should we open it?
88
00:06:38,461 --> 00:06:39,921
Maybe her son should.
89
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,384
I'm authorized to show the apartment.
90
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,262
Well!
91
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:48,972
Whatever she locked in
got out.
92
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:52,183
Well, perhaps she didn't
need five closets.
93
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,728
Why would she cover up her vacuum
cleaner and her towels?
94
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,481
I don't suppose we'll ever know.
95
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,775
Maybe she was becoming senile after all.
96
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:02,277
Is there anything else?
97
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,070
Yes, please. What about
the laundry facilities?
98
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,906
It's bigger than the other one.
99
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:07,782
Yeah. It's more expensive,
too, you know?
100
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:11,161
It's better located.
101
00:07:11,202 --> 00:07:12,787
Yeah, well, God knows,
102
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:14,372
I could walk to all the
theaters from here.
103
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:16,458
Oh, Guy, let's take it, please?
104
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:18,001
That living room could be--
105
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:19,669
Oh, please, let's take it.
106
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:22,255
Okay, darling, we get out
of the other lease, okay.
107
00:07:22,297 --> 00:07:23,882
I was tempted to write the management
108
00:07:23,924 --> 00:07:26,009
that you were drug addicts
and litterbugs.
109
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:28,345
Instead, I decided to lie
110
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:29,888
and tell them you were
wonderful tenants.
111
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,182
Oh, you're great, Hutch.
112
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:33,600
Wish I could talk you out of it, though.
113
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,101
He's pulling your leg, Ro honey.
114
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:36,686
Indeed I'm not.
115
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:38,521
Now, that looks great.
That is--
116
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:40,106
Are you aware that the Bramford
117
00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:43,693
had rather an unpleasant reputation
around the turn of the century?
118
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,862
It's where the Trench sisters
119
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:48,531
conducted their little
dietary experiments
120
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:50,867
and Keith Kennedy held his parties.
121
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,286
Adrian Marcato lived there, too.
So did Pearl Ames.
122
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:54,371
Who were the Trench sisters?
123
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:55,705
Who was Adrian Marcato?
124
00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:58,833
The Trench sisters were two
proper Victorian ladies.
125
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,045
They cooked and ate several young
children, including a niece.
126
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:03,546
Oh, lovely.
127
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:06,216
Adrian Marcato practiced witchcraft.
128
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:08,051
He made quite a splash in the nineties
129
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:10,720
by announcing that he'd conjured
up the living devil.
130
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,597
Apparently, people believed him,
131
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,391
so they attacked and nearly killed him
132
00:08:14,432 --> 00:08:15,892
in the lobby of the Bramford.
133
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:17,477
You're joking.
134
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,562
Later, the Keith Kennedy business began,
135
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:22,065
and by the twenties, the
house was half empty.
136
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:23,566
I knew about Keith Kennedy.
137
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,151
I didn't know that Marcato
lived there.
138
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:26,486
And those sisters.
139
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:28,071
World War ll filled the house up again.
140
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:30,407
Terrific.
141
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:31,866
What? The house?
142
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:33,118
The lamb.
Oh.
143
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,620
They called it Black Bramford.
144
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:39,249
But, Hutch, awful things happen
in every apartment house.
145
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,626
Ah, but this house has a high incidence
of unpleasant happenings.
146
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:45,338
In '59, a dead infant was found,
147
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,590
wrapped in newspaper in the basement.
148
00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:49,926
Mmm! You really rouse my appetite.
149
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:52,429
Have some more wine.
150
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:31,384
Roman!
151
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:33,553
Bring me in some root beer
when you come!
152
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:10,924
Hey, these are shelves.
153
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:26,689
Hey...
154
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:28,525
let's make love.
155
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,110
Shh!
156
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,281
I think I hear the Trench
sisters chewing.
157
00:11:58,323 --> 00:11:59,616
Ohl
158
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:13,630
Straight up to the left.
159
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:16,382
Here in Daytona, Florida,
160
00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:18,801
it's the 250-cc 100-mile classic
161
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:21,679
with Yamaha leading the
pack on the final lap...
162
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,974
and winning it, as Yamaha takes
7 of the top 10 places.
163
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:27,685
It's the third straight year
for Yamaha, a clean sweep.
164
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:30,772
Yamaha is race bred from champions,
165
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:32,065
and, as you can see,
166
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:34,567
we have a model for
every kind of riding.
167
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:37,403
You know, you really should discover
the swingin' world of Yamaha.
168
00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:38,488
Why don't you get on, have a ride?
169
00:12:38,488 --> 00:12:39,948
Come on. Get on.
170
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:41,324
Okay, come on.
Let's go.
171
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:48,331
Look.
172
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:56,130
It's great.
173
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,275
I'm sorry. I thought you were
Victoria Vetri, the actress.
174
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:17,694
I'm sorry.
175
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:19,028
That's all right.
176
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:20,697
A lot of people think I'm Victoria.
177
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:22,323
I don't see any resemblance.
178
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:23,408
Do you know her?
179
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:24,659
No.
180
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:29,163
My name's Terry Gionoffrio.
181
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,541
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.
182
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:34,043
Uh, we-- We're new tenants here.
183
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:36,462
I'm staying with the Castevets,
seventh floor.
184
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:38,715
I'm their guest, sort of, since June.
185
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:40,717
Our apartment used to be
the back part of yours.
186
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:42,093
Oh, for goodness sakes.
187
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:43,720
You took the old lady's
apartment. Mrs., uh--
188
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,264
Yeah, um, Miss, uh...
Gard-- Gardenia.
189
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:49,058
Gardenia. Yeah.
She was a good friend of the Castevets.
190
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,727
She used to grow all kinds of herbs
and things for her to cook with.
191
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:52,854
I saw those plants.
192
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:53,813
Yeah. Well, now, she
grows her own things.
193
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:56,232
Excuse me a moment.
I have to put the softener in.
194
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,403
What does your husband do?
He's an actor.
195
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:01,696
No kidding?
What's his name?
196
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:03,072
Guy Woodhouse.
197
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:06,743
He was in Luther and Nobody
Loves an Albatross,
198
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,077
and he does a lot of
television and radio.
199
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:11,247
Gee, I watch TV all day long.
200
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:12,457
I'll bet I've seen him.
201
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,752
Wow!
Ooh!
202
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:18,254
I hate this basement.
203
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:19,547
Yeah, me, too.
204
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:21,090
It gives me the creeps.
205
00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:22,717
Listen, why don't we come
down here together regular
206
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,968
and do our laundry?
207
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,928
Okay, that would be great.
208
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:27,513
I have a good luck charm.
209
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:28,723
It might work for both of us.
210
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,560
Oh, that's beautiful.
211
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:34,604
Isn't it?
Mmm-hmm!
212
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:36,647
Mrs. Castevet gave it to me.
It's good luck.
213
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,066
Anyway, it's supposed to be.
214
00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:39,025
It's got some stuff inside.
215
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:44,697
Ha, ha, hal
216
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:46,282
I'm not mad about the smell either.
217
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:47,575
I hope it works.
218
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:48,826
It's a beautiful charm, though.
219
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:50,620
I've never seen anything like it.
220
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:52,622
European.
221
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:55,833
The Castevets are the most wonderful
people in the world, bar none.
222
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,502
You know, they picked me up
off the sidewalk, literally?
223
00:14:57,543 --> 00:14:58,461
You were sick?
224
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:00,963
I was starving and on dope
225
00:15:00,963 --> 00:15:02,632
and doing a lot of other things.
226
00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:03,883
They're childless, though.
227
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:05,802
I'm like the daughter they never had.
228
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:08,221
At first, I thought they wanted
me for some kind of sex thing,
229
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:09,889
but they've turned out to
be like real grandparents.
230
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,226
It's nice to know there
are people like that
231
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:15,770
when you hear so much about apathy
232
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:18,314
and people who are afraid
of getting involved.
233
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:20,066
I'd be dead now if it wasn't for them.
234
00:15:20,108 --> 00:15:22,693
That's an absolute fact,
dead or in jail.
235
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:24,779
You don't have any family
that could have helped you?
236
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,323
A brother in the navy.
237
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:31,536
Why, it's impossible to be 100% sure!
238
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:34,664
If you want my opinion, we
shouldn't tell her at all!
239
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:35,957
That's my opinion!
240
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:38,167
That must be the partition.
241
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:42,171
That's the back part of the original
10 with a dining room,
242
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:44,090
and there's--
there's a closet over here,
243
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:45,341
and then there's a closet over here.
244
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,174
Stay back, huh, lady?
245
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,975
Get back now, will you, please?
246
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:37,310
Get back. There's nothing to see.
247
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,228
Get back, will you, please?
248
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:42,982
Jesus.
249
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,193
Get back!
250
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:46,527
We know her.
251
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:47,528
What's her name?
252
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:49,447
Terry.
253
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:50,406
Terry what?
254
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,533
Ro?
255
00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:53,576
What was her name again?
256
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:54,827
Terry what?
257
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:56,162
uh...
258
00:16:56,204 --> 00:16:58,414
I don't remember.
An Italian name.
259
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:00,082
She was staying with some
people named Castevet,
260
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:01,209
7-E.
261
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,919
Yeah. We got that already.
262
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:05,755
Short and sweet.
263
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:07,840
She stuck it to the windowsill
with a Band-Aid. Come on.
264
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,841
Get back.
265
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:10,468
Theresa Gionoffrio.
266
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,802
Move on!
267
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:13,262
Move on!
268
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:15,973
You knew her?
269
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:17,683
Only slightly.
270
00:17:17,725 --> 00:17:19,060
Come on, Ro baby.
Let's go.
271
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:20,478
Oh! Here they come.
272
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:26,192
You folks the Castevets
on the seventh floor?
273
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:27,443
We are.
274
00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:28,486
You have a young woman
275
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:30,863
named Theresa Gionoffrio
living with you?
276
00:17:30,905 --> 00:17:32,949
We do. What's wrong?
Has there been an accident?
277
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,408
You'd better brace yourself
278
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,618
for some bad news.
279
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:36,661
She's dead.
280
00:17:37,662 --> 00:17:39,080
Jumped out of the window.
281
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:41,582
That's not possible!
That's a mistake!
282
00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:44,293
Artie, you want to let these
folks take a look, please?
283
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:48,631
I knew this would happen.
284
00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:52,301
She got deeply depressed
every three weeks or so.
285
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:54,428
I told my wife about it,
but she pooh-poohed me.
286
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:58,975
Well, that-- that doesn't
mean she killed herself.
287
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:00,726
She was a very happy girl
288
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:02,478
with no reason for self-destruction.
289
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,189
She must have been cleaning
the windows or something.
290
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:06,941
She wasn't cleaning windows at midnight.
291
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:08,818
Why not? Maybe she was!
292
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:09,944
Is that her handwriting?
293
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:13,864
Yeah.
294
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:15,283
Definitely.
Absolutely.
295
00:18:15,324 --> 00:18:16,659
Thank you.
296
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:18,911
I'll see this gets back to
you when we're done with it.
297
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:20,037
I don't believe it.
298
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,330
I just don't believe it.
299
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:22,832
She was so happy.
300
00:18:22,873 --> 00:18:24,292
Who's the next of kin?
301
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,210
She's all alone.
She didn't have anybody,
302
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:27,587
only us.
303
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:30,172
Didn't she have a brother?
Did she?
304
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:32,717
She said she did.
In the navy.
305
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:34,176
News to me.
306
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:35,636
Do you know where he's stationed?
307
00:18:35,678 --> 00:18:37,972
No, I don't.
308
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:40,600
She mentioned him to me
in the laundry room.
309
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,851
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.
310
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,270
Uh, we're in, uh, 7-E.
311
00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:46,439
I feel just the way you
do, Mrs. Castevet.
312
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,525
She seemed so happy and full of--
313
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:52,194
She said wonderful things
about you and your husband,
314
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:53,696
how grateful she was.
315
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:55,239
Thank you.
316
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:56,574
You know anything else
about this brother
317
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:57,783
except he's in the navy?
318
00:18:57,825 --> 00:18:59,035
No, I don't.
319
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:00,244
It should be easy
to find him.
320
00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:02,288
Okay.
321
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,040
I'm so stunned.
I'm so sorry.
322
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,416
It's such a pity.
323
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,375
Well, thank you.
324
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,461
Sometimes I wonder how come you're
the leader of anything.
325
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,763
Please don't tell me
what Laura-Louise said
326
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:02,807
because I'm not interested.
327
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:03,974
If you'd listened to me,
328
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:06,268
we wouldn't have had to do this!
329
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,104
We'd have been all set to go now
330
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:10,523
instead of having to start
all over from scratch!
331
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:12,483
I told you not to tell her in advance!
332
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:14,735
I told you she wouldn't be open-minded!
333
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,366
I told Sister Veronica
about the windows,
334
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:22,284
and she withdrew the school
from the competition.
335
00:20:22,284 --> 00:20:23,619
Otherwise, we would--
336
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,379
Hello. How are you?
337
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:34,839
Fine. May I come in a minute?
338
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,257
Yes, of course. Please do.
339
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:37,675
I just come over to thank you
340
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:39,385
for saying those nice things
to us the other night.
341
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:40,970
Oh, no, please.
There's--
342
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,846
Poor Terry.
343
00:20:41,846 --> 00:20:43,556
We thought maybe we'd
failed her some way,
344
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:45,599
although her note made it
crystal clear we hadn't.
345
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:47,560
You'll never know how helpful it was
346
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:49,103
in such a shock moment.
347
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:50,479
So I do thank you.
Roman does, too.
348
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:52,773
Roman's my hubby.
349
00:20:52,815 --> 00:20:53,983
You're welcome.
350
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,276
I'm glad I could help.
351
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:58,195
Yeah. Well, she was cremated yesterday.
352
00:20:58,237 --> 00:20:59,947
Now we got to forget and go on.
353
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:02,158
It won't be easy.
We don't have any children of our own.
354
00:21:02,158 --> 00:21:03,409
You have any?
No, we don't.
355
00:21:03,451 --> 00:21:04,785
Oh, well, there you have it.
356
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:06,912
Ohh! Oh,
357
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:08,748
that's a nice--
358
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,207
Look how you put the table!
359
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:11,709
Now, isn't that interesting?
360
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:13,002
I saw it in a magazine.
361
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:15,629
Oh, my. Nice paint job.
362
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:16,839
I know.
363
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:18,424
Ahh... well.
364
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:19,675
That's nice.
What is that?
365
00:21:19,717 --> 00:21:21,010
That's the TV room?
366
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:22,803
Yeah, well, only temporarily.
367
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:24,096
It's going to be a nursery.
368
00:21:24,138 --> 00:21:25,181
Oh, you're pregnant?
369
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,599
No, not yet.
370
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,350
I hope to be as soon as we're settled.
371
00:21:28,392 --> 00:21:30,269
Wonderful. Well, you're
young and healthy.
372
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:31,771
You ought to have lots of children.
373
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:33,522
We plan to have three.
374
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:35,399
I'm dying to see what you
did to this apartment.
375
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,318
The woman who had it before
was a dear friend of mine.
376
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,652
I know.
Terry told me.
377
00:21:38,694 --> 00:21:40,029
Oh, did she?
378
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,031
You two had some long talks
together in the laundry room.
379
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:43,240
Only one.
380
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:45,534
Oh! Oh, my goodness!
381
00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:48,370
Ah, ha, ha! It looks so much brighter.
382
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:50,498
What do you pay for a chair like that?
383
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:51,832
Uh, oh...
384
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:53,167
um, I'm not sure, really.
385
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,543
I think about $200.
386
00:21:54,585 --> 00:21:55,711
Hmm.
387
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:58,589
What does your hubby do?
388
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:00,216
He's an actor.
389
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:02,885
I knew it! I said it to Roman yesterday.
390
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:05,054
He's so good-looking.
391
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:06,680
What movies was he in?
392
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:08,140
No movies.
393
00:22:08,182 --> 00:22:09,892
He was in two plays called Luther
394
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:11,519
and Nobody Loves an Albatross
395
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,771
and a lot of television and radio.
396
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:15,189
Listen, Rosemary...
397
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:17,066
I got a 2-inch thick sirloin steak
398
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:18,651
sitting defrosting right this minute.
399
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:20,069
Why don't you and Guy come over,
400
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:21,111
have supper with us tonight?
401
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:22,363
What do you say?
402
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:23,531
Oh, no. We couldn't.
403
00:22:23,572 --> 00:22:24,824
Why not?
404
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:27,076
No, really, that's very kind of you.
Listen--
405
00:22:27,117 --> 00:22:29,328
It would be a real help to us. Oh--
406
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,456
First night we'll be alone since--
407
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:34,959
Oh, are you sure it wouldn't
be too much trouble for you?
408
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,335
Oh, honey, if it was trouble,
409
00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:37,795
I wouldn't ask you.
410
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:39,922
All right.
You go ahead and count on us.
411
00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:41,507
I'll have to check with Guy,
though.
412
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:44,760
Listen, you tell him I won't
take no for an answer!
413
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:46,220
Oh! Here's your mail!
414
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:47,596
Oh! Ads!
415
00:22:47,638 --> 00:22:48,806
Thank you.
416
00:22:58,607 --> 00:22:59,775
Yoo-hoo!
417
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:01,360
Hey.
418
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,612
Mmm!
419
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,877
Donald Baumgart got that part.
420
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:32,474
It's a bad play anyway.
421
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:34,184
Yeah. Even if it folds out of town,
422
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:35,477
it's the kind of part that gets noticed.
423
00:23:42,902 --> 00:23:44,403
Mrs. Castevet was here
424
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:47,406
to thank me for what I said about Terry.
425
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:51,660
She is the nosiest person
I've ever seen.
426
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:54,163
You know she actually asked
the prices of things?
427
00:23:54,204 --> 00:23:55,497
No kidding.
428
00:23:57,374 --> 00:23:59,919
She invited us to have dinner
with them tonight.
429
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,629
I told her I'd have to check with you,
430
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,422
but that it would probably be okay.
431
00:24:03,464 --> 00:24:05,341
Oh, Jesus! We don't have
to do that, do we, honey?
432
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:08,344
I think they're lonely.
433
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:10,304
We get friendly with an
old couple like that,
434
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:11,430
and we'll never get rid of them.
435
00:24:11,472 --> 00:24:12,640
They're right across the wall.
436
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:15,017
I told her she could count on us.
437
00:24:19,188 --> 00:24:20,189
You don't have to sulk about it.
438
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,440
I'm not sulking.
439
00:24:21,482 --> 00:24:22,524
I see exactly what you mean.
440
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:24,860
Hell, we'll go.
441
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:26,362
No, no. What for?
442
00:24:26,362 --> 00:24:27,738
We'll go!
443
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,908
No. We don't have to
if you don't want to.
444
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,535
That sounds so phony, but I
really mean it, really, I do.
445
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:36,664
Be my good deed for the day.
446
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,502
Okay, but only if you want to.
447
00:24:41,543 --> 00:24:43,712
We'll make it clear that it's
just for this one night
448
00:24:43,754 --> 00:24:46,507
and not the beginning
of anything, right?
449
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:49,218
Oh! Perfect timing!
Come oniin.
450
00:24:49,218 --> 00:24:51,637
Roman's fixing us some vodka blushes.
451
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,889
My, I'm glad you could come, Guy.
452
00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:56,600
I'm fixing to tell everybody
that I knew you when.
453
00:24:56,642 --> 00:24:58,102
Look, dinner isn't ready just yet,
454
00:24:58,143 --> 00:24:59,561
but sit down there anywhere.
455
00:24:59,561 --> 00:25:01,230
Take a seat on the couch.
456
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:02,439
You'll find yourself very comfortable.
457
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:05,025
I seem to have overfilled the glasses.
458
00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:06,902
No, no, no.
Don't get up.
459
00:25:06,944 --> 00:25:10,030
Generally, I pour these out precisely
as a bartender, don't I, Minnie?
460
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:11,573
Just watch the carpet.
461
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:13,534
But this evening I made
a little too much,
462
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:15,244
and rather I'm afr--
Oh, there we are.
463
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:17,204
No, no, no.
Sit down, please.
464
00:25:17,246 --> 00:25:18,872
Now, Mrs. Woodhouse--
Thank you.
465
00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:20,416
Uh, Mr. Woodhouse,
466
00:25:20,457 --> 00:25:22,626
uh, vodka blush?
Yes, thanks.
467
00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:24,169
Have you ever tasted one?
468
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:25,421
No, no.
I haven't.
469
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:26,714
It looks delicious.
470
00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:29,425
Minnie. They're very
popular in Australia.
471
00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:31,802
Now, to our guests--
Welcome to our home.
472
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:32,928
Hear, hear.
473
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,013
Cheers.
474
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:34,972
Mmm.
475
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:39,852
The carpet.
476
00:25:39,893 --> 00:25:41,228
Oh, dear.
477
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,688
Brand-new carpet.
478
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,399
This man is so clumsy!
479
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:48,444
Do you come from Australia?
480
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:51,196
Oh, no, no. I'm from right
here in New York City.
481
00:25:51,238 --> 00:25:52,781
I've been there, though.
482
00:25:52,823 --> 00:25:55,242
I've been everywhere, literally.
483
00:25:55,284 --> 00:25:57,411
You name a place, and I've been there.
484
00:25:57,453 --> 00:25:59,246
Go ahead. Name a place.
485
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:00,456
Fairbanks, Alaska!
486
00:26:00,456 --> 00:26:03,125
I've been there, been all over Alaska--
487
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:07,504
Yes-- Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage,
Nome, Sitka, Seward.
488
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:09,298
I spent four months there in '38--
489
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:10,424
Where are you folks from?
490
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:11,550
Well--
Well, I--
491
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:14,636
I'm from Omaha.
Guy's from Baltimore.
492
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:15,971
Omaha's a good city.
493
00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:16,638
Baltimore is, too.
494
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:19,141
Do you travel for business?
495
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:21,101
Well, business and pleasure both.
496
00:26:21,143 --> 00:26:24,688
I'm 79, and I've been going one
place or another since I was 10.
497
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,315
You name a place, I've been there.
498
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:27,649
Ah! Steak's ready.
499
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:28,776
Don't rush your drinks, now.
500
00:26:29,777 --> 00:26:30,986
Roman, take your pill!
501
00:26:32,362 --> 00:26:34,156
No pope ever visits a city
502
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:35,949
where the newspapers are on strike.
503
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:37,659
I heard he's going to postpone
504
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:39,078
and wait till it's over.
505
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,995
Well, that's show biz.
506
00:26:42,498 --> 00:26:43,916
That's exactly what it is.
507
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,293
All the costumes are rituals,
508
00:26:46,335 --> 00:26:47,878
all religions.
509
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,797
Oh, I think we're offending Rosemary.
510
00:26:49,838 --> 00:26:51,048
No, no.
511
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,966
No, you're not religious,
my dear, are you?
512
00:26:53,008 --> 00:26:55,010
Well, I was brought up a Catholic.
513
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,512
Now I don't know.
514
00:26:56,512 --> 00:26:58,138
You looked uncomfortable.
515
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,765
Well, he is the pope.
516
00:26:59,807 --> 00:27:01,975
Now, you don't need to
have respect for him
517
00:27:02,017 --> 00:27:03,936
because he pretends that he's holy.
518
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:05,270
Now, that's a good point.
519
00:27:05,312 --> 00:27:08,899
When I think what they spend
on robes and jewels!
520
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:12,694
A good picture of the hypocrisy
behind organized religion
521
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:14,863
was given, I thought, in Luther.
522
00:27:14,905 --> 00:27:16,865
Did you ever get to play
that leading part, Guy?
523
00:27:16,907 --> 00:27:17,866
Me? No.
524
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:20,786
Weren't you Albert Finney's understudy?
525
00:27:20,828 --> 00:27:22,246
No.
526
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:23,539
Well, that's strange.
527
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,332
I remember being struck
by a gesture you made
528
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:26,375
and checking in the program
529
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:27,501
to see who you were.
530
00:27:27,543 --> 00:27:28,752
Thank you.
531
00:27:28,794 --> 00:27:30,712
Um, what gesture was that?
532
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:33,882
Well, I'm not sure now.
It was a reaction--
533
00:27:33,924 --> 00:27:35,884
Oh, I did a thing with my arms
534
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:37,511
when Luther was having a fit.
535
00:27:37,553 --> 00:27:39,972
It was a kind of involuntary reach.
536
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:43,517
That's it! That's it.
It had a wonderful authenticity to it.
537
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,643
Oh, come on.
538
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:46,603
No, no.
I mean it.
539
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:48,897
My father was a theatrical producer,
540
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:52,025
and my early years were
spent in the company
541
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:54,695
of Mrs. Fiske, Forbes-Robertson,
Modjeska.
542
00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:55,779
Guy?
543
00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:57,573
Oh, yes, please.
544
00:27:57,573 --> 00:28:00,826
You have a most interesting
inner quality, Guy.
545
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:03,495
It appears in your television work, too.
546
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:05,247
It should take you a long way, indeed,
547
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:08,125
provided, of course, that you
get those initial breaks.
548
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:10,752
Are you preparing for a show now?
549
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:14,756
Um, well, I'm up for a couple parts.
550
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:16,967
Well, I can't believe that
you won't get them.
551
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:18,635
Well, I can.
552
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:20,762
I'd like to have a spice garden someday.
553
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:23,891
I guess I'm a country girl at heart.
554
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:25,350
You come from a big family?
555
00:28:25,392 --> 00:28:26,602
Mm-hmm.
556
00:28:26,602 --> 00:28:28,061
Three brothers and two sisters.
557
00:28:28,103 --> 00:28:29,104
Your sisters married?
558
00:28:29,104 --> 00:28:30,355
Mm-hmm.
559
00:28:30,397 --> 00:28:31,773
They have children?
560
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:34,067
One has two, the other has four.
561
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:36,486
There's a chance you'll have
lots of children, too.
562
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:38,572
We're fertile, all right.
563
00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:40,699
I've got 16 nieces and nephews.
564
00:28:40,741 --> 00:28:42,618
Oh, my goodness!
565
00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:50,459
Would you like me to wash, and
you can wipe for a while?
566
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:52,044
Oh, no.
That's fine, dear.
567
00:29:00,344 --> 00:29:03,639
Now, Roman, will you stop
bending Guy's ears
568
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:05,474
with your Modjeska stories?
569
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:07,309
He's only listening 'cause he's polite.
570
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:08,852
No, no, no, no.
It's very interesting, Mrs. Castevet.
571
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:10,229
Minnie!
572
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,897
I'm Minnie.
He's Roman, okay?
573
00:29:11,939 --> 00:29:13,398
Okay?
574
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,524
Okay.
575
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:15,817
Okay!
576
00:29:15,817 --> 00:29:17,236
Terrific.
Just terrific.
577
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:18,320
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye.
578
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,571
Thank you for having us.
579
00:29:19,613 --> 00:29:20,989
Yeah, it was lovely.
Oh, bless you.
580
00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:22,282
Minnie!
581
00:29:22,324 --> 00:29:24,201
Minnie, ya good kid, ya.
582
00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:26,578
Ooh!
About that steak, huh?
583
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,497
Oh, my God!
And the cake.
584
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:29,957
How did you eat two pieces?
585
00:29:29,998 --> 00:29:31,291
It was weird.
586
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,001
Out of politeness.
That's how I ate two pieces.
587
00:29:33,043 --> 00:29:34,086
Out of politeness.
588
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:35,963
Ha, ha, hal
589
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:37,881
Only three dinner plates that matched.
590
00:29:37,923 --> 00:29:39,883
Shh!
591
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:42,970
And all that beautiful,
beautiful silver.
592
00:29:43,011 --> 00:29:44,012
We'll be nice.
Maybe they'll will it to us.
593
00:29:44,054 --> 00:29:45,180
Ohl
594
00:29:45,222 --> 00:29:46,932
Yeah.
595
00:29:46,974 --> 00:29:48,475
Guess what they have in their bathroom.
596
00:29:48,517 --> 00:29:50,143
A bidet.
597
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:51,061
Jokes for the John.
598
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:52,604
No.
599
00:29:52,646 --> 00:29:54,189
A book on a hook right
next to the toilet.
600
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:57,859
Roman's stories are pretty
damned interesting, though.
601
00:29:57,901 --> 00:29:58,986
Yeah?
602
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:02,656
Never even heard of Forbes-Robertson
before.
603
00:30:02,698 --> 00:30:05,284
I'm going to go over there again
tomorrow night and hear some more.
604
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:07,244
You are?
Yeah. He asked me.
605
00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:09,371
Here. Do this damn thing
for me, will you?
606
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:11,290
I thought we were going to do something
with Joan and Dick Jellico.
607
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:13,542
Was that definite?
Well, it wasn't definite.
608
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:14,793
We'll see them next week.
609
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:19,214
You don't have to come along
if you don't want to.
610
00:30:19,256 --> 00:30:20,674
You can stay here.
611
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:23,927
Yeah, I think I will stay here.
612
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,805
He knew Henry Irving, too.
613
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:29,099
I mean, really interesting, you know?
614
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:31,059
Why did they take their pictures down?
615
00:30:32,227 --> 00:30:33,603
What do you mean?
616
00:30:33,645 --> 00:30:35,564
Their pictures.
They took them down.
617
00:30:35,605 --> 00:30:38,317
The hooks in the wall and clean spaces
618
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:40,277
and the one picture that
is there doesn't fit.
619
00:30:41,194 --> 00:30:42,154
I didn't notice that.
620
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:22,819
Hi, dear. We're not bothering
you, are we?
621
00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:24,446
This is my dear friend
Laura-Louise McBurney,
622
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:25,781
lives up on 12.
623
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:28,075
Laura-Louise, this is
Guy's wife, Rosemary.
624
00:31:28,116 --> 00:31:30,327
Hello, Rosemary.
Welcome to the Bram!
625
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:32,746
Laura-Louise just met Guy.
She wanted to meet you, too.
626
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:33,997
Could we come in?
627
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:36,083
Uh, of course.
Please do.
628
00:31:36,124 --> 00:31:37,542
There you are.
Go ahead.
629
00:31:37,584 --> 00:31:38,627
Oh, look what you got.
630
00:31:38,627 --> 00:31:39,836
There's a light.
631
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:42,798
Oh, gosh!
632
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,716
Isn't that beautiful!
633
00:31:44,758 --> 00:31:46,593
It came this morning.
634
00:31:46,635 --> 00:31:48,303
Are you all right, dear?
You look worn.
635
00:31:48,345 --> 00:31:49,596
Oh, no. I'm fine.
636
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:51,139
It's the first day of my period.
637
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:52,724
And you're up and around?
638
00:31:52,766 --> 00:31:55,227
On my first day, I experienced
such pain,
639
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:57,979
I couldn't move, eat, or anything.
640
00:31:58,021 --> 00:32:01,149
Dan used to give me gin through
a straw to kill the pain.
641
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:03,944
Girls today take things much
more in their stride.
642
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:05,529
They're much healthier than we were,
643
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,281
Thanks to vitamins, better medical care.
644
00:32:08,323 --> 00:32:10,492
What are those things over
there, seat covers?
645
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:12,411
Um, cushions for the window seats.
646
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:13,787
Oh, yeah.
647
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,877
Oh, before I forget.
648
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:24,339
This is for you from Roman and me.
649
00:32:24,381 --> 00:32:26,341
For me?
650
00:32:26,341 --> 00:32:28,635
It's just a little present
is all. For moving in.
651
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:29,970
There's no reason--
652
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:31,847
It's real old.
It's over 300 years.
653
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:41,940
It's lovely.
654
00:32:41,982 --> 00:32:44,443
Yeah. The green inside
is called tannis root.
655
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:45,819
That's for good luck.
656
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:49,364
It's lovely, but I--
I can't accept it.
657
00:32:49,364 --> 00:32:50,449
You already have.
658
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,533
Put it on.
659
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:52,826
Yeah.
660
00:32:55,412 --> 00:32:58,290
Ah, you'll get used to the
smell before you know it.
661
00:32:58,331 --> 00:32:59,541
Yeah, go on.
662
00:33:01,877 --> 00:33:04,087
Ohh, yes.
663
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:08,258
Were his stories as interesting
as last night?
664
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,385
Yes. Did you have a good time?
665
00:33:10,385 --> 00:33:11,636
All right.
666
00:33:11,678 --> 00:33:12,888
I got a present.
667
00:33:15,682 --> 00:33:16,808
It was Terry's.
668
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,059
No kidding?
669
00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:19,227
Kind of pretty, though.
670
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:24,900
Aren't you going to wear it?
671
00:33:24,941 --> 00:33:26,318
Mm-mmm.
It smells.
672
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:28,945
There's stuff in it called tannis root
673
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:30,822
from her greenhouse.
674
00:33:30,864 --> 00:33:32,407
Not too bad, though.
675
00:33:32,449 --> 00:33:33,617
Ha, ha, ha.
676
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:43,502
Tannis, anyone?
677
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:45,003
Well, if you took it,
678
00:33:45,045 --> 00:33:46,213
you ought to wear it.
679
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:05,815
Hello.
680
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:07,234
Yes.
681
00:34:07,275 --> 00:34:08,151
This is he.
682
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,952
Oh, God, no.
683
00:34:19,704 --> 00:34:20,539
Oh, the poor guy.
684
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,251
And, uh...
685
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:26,711
they don't have any idea
what's causing it?
686
00:34:26,753 --> 00:34:28,296
Oh, my God.
That's awful.
687
00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:29,381
That's just awful.
688
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:32,926
Yes, I would.
689
00:34:33,843 --> 00:34:35,136
I mean, yes, I am.
690
00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:39,182
I hate to get it that way, but--
691
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:43,728
Well, you'd have to speak to my agent
692
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,646
about that end of it.
693
00:34:47,274 --> 00:34:49,025
Alan Stone.
694
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:50,652
I'm sure there won't be
any problem, Mr. Weiss,
695
00:34:50,652 --> 00:34:51,987
not as far as we're concerned.
696
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:55,323
Thank you, Mr. Weiss.
697
00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:01,329
Guy?
698
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:03,999
What is it?
699
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,672
Donald Baumgart--
He's gone blind.
700
00:35:12,257 --> 00:35:14,009
He woke up yesterday, and he can't see.
701
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:16,553
Oh, no.
702
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:17,554
Oh, I've got the part.
703
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:20,640
It's a hell of a way to get it.
704
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,690
Listen, uh,
705
00:35:28,732 --> 00:35:30,025
I have to get out and walk around.
706
00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:31,443
I understand.
Go ahead.
707
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,124
Baumgart--
Donald Baumgart.
708
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:49,294
It's a fascinating part.
709
00:35:49,336 --> 00:35:51,212
He'll really be noticed this time.
710
00:35:51,254 --> 00:35:52,881
He also has an offer for a lead
711
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:55,258
in a television series, Miami
Beach.
712
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,385
He's suddenly very hot.
713
00:35:57,385 --> 00:36:00,930
Mm-hmm. I understand why
you're so overjoyed.
714
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:04,517
Well, it's a difficult
period in his life.
715
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:05,477
A challenge.
716
00:36:06,645 --> 00:36:07,979
I see.
717
00:36:08,021 --> 00:36:09,230
You know how actors are.
718
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,399
They're all a bit self-centered.
719
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:13,068
I'll bet even Laurence Olivier
720
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:14,694
is vain and self-centered.
721
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:18,740
It's a difficult part.
722
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,200
He's got to work with crutches,
723
00:36:20,241 --> 00:36:23,078
and, naturally, he's preoccupied.
724
00:36:23,912 --> 00:36:25,080
And he--
725
00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:27,290
Well, preoccupied.
726
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:32,587
I see you had another suicide
up there at happy house.
727
00:36:32,587 --> 00:36:34,381
Oh, didn't I tell you?
728
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:35,423
No, you didn't.
729
00:36:35,465 --> 00:36:37,509
It was that girl I told you about,
730
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,637
the drug-addict who was rehabilitated
by this old couple, the Castevets.
731
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,263
I'm sure I told you that.
732
00:36:42,263 --> 00:36:45,183
They didn't rehabilitate her
very successfully, it seems.
733
00:37:07,122 --> 00:37:08,331
I've been a creep.
734
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:11,626
It's from worrying if Baumgart
would regain his sight,
735
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:12,752
rat that I am.
736
00:37:12,794 --> 00:37:14,003
Oh, it's natural.
737
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:15,630
You're bound to feel two ways about it.
738
00:37:15,672 --> 00:37:17,882
Even if I'm Mr. Yamaha
for the rest of my days,
739
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:19,467
I'm going to stop giving you
the short end of the stick.
740
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:20,552
You haven't been.
741
00:37:20,593 --> 00:37:22,053
Yes, I have.
742
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:24,305
I've been tearing my hair
out over my career.
743
00:37:24,347 --> 00:37:27,142
Let's have a baby.
All right?
744
00:37:27,142 --> 00:37:29,310
Let's have three babies,
one at a time, all right?
745
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:31,479
A baby. You know.
746
00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:33,565
Mama, Dada, poo-poo.
You know?
747
00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:34,774
You mean it?
748
00:37:34,816 --> 00:37:35,942
Sure, I mean it.
749
00:37:35,984 --> 00:37:37,902
I mean, I even figured out
the right time to start,
750
00:37:37,944 --> 00:37:39,154
look.
751
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,490
You mean it, really?
752
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,701
No, I'm kidding.
Sure, I mean it.
753
00:37:46,536 --> 00:37:48,955
Oh, Ro, honey, for God's
sake, don't cry.
754
00:37:48,997 --> 00:37:50,415
I won't. I won't.
755
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:51,416
Ha, ha, ha.
756
00:37:56,171 --> 00:37:57,464
Here goes nothing.
757
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:10,894
The paint!
758
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:12,520
The paint!
759
00:38:12,562 --> 00:38:13,563
Good grief.
760
00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:25,575
Nobody, but nobody has a fire tonight.
761
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,958
Isn't it gorgeous?
762
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,752
I hope we have the coldest winter ever.
763
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:53,394
Oh, shit!
764
00:39:00,735 --> 00:39:02,403
Hi, Guy!
765
00:39:02,403 --> 00:39:03,196
How are ya?
766
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:05,031
No, don't let her in.
767
00:39:05,073 --> 00:39:06,783
Not tonight.
768
00:39:06,825 --> 00:39:07,784
Oh, that's very kind of you.
769
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,873
Oh, are you sure
770
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:14,499
you don't want to come in?
771
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,501
No! I don't want to bother you.
772
00:39:19,587 --> 00:39:20,630
Good.
773
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:24,384
Good.
774
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:26,594
Who says there's nothing to E.S.P.?
775
00:39:26,636 --> 00:39:29,430
Madame and monsieur shall have
ze dessert after all!
776
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,849
Mousse au chocolat.
777
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,309
Or as Minnie calls it--
chocolate mouse.
778
00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:36,938
I was afraid she'd stay all evening.
779
00:39:36,938 --> 00:39:39,065
She just wanted us to try it.
780
00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:41,568
Seein' it's one of her specialities.
781
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:43,152
It was sweet of her, really.
782
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:44,654
We shouldn't make fun of her.
783
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:45,655
Yeah, you're right, you're
right, you're right.
784
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,545
Mmm! It's good.
785
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:17,645
Has an undertaste.
786
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:20,982
A chalky undertaste.
787
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:24,569
I don't get it.
788
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:27,405
That's silly, honey.
789
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:29,073
There is no undertaste.
790
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:29,991
There is.
791
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:34,162
Come on. The old bat slaved all day.
Now eat it.
792
00:40:34,162 --> 00:40:35,246
I don't like it.
793
00:40:35,288 --> 00:40:36,581
It's delicious.
794
00:40:36,623 --> 00:40:38,750
Here.
You can have mine.
795
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:40,501
All right. Don't eat it.
There's always something wrong.
796
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,297
Oh, if it's going to turn
into a big thing--
797
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:46,257
Look, if you really can't stand
it, just don't eat it.
798
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:49,719
Mmm! It's delicious!
No undertaste at all.
799
00:40:52,221 --> 00:40:53,932
Would you turn the record over, please?
800
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,907
There, Daddy, do I get a gold star?
801
00:41:10,949 --> 00:41:11,908
You get two of them.
802
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:14,118
I'm sorry if I was stuffy.
803
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,329
You were.
804
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:17,580
...Is making a full circle
of the ball park...
805
00:41:17,622 --> 00:41:20,041
It's the pope at Yankee Stadium!
806
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,584
...to his specially built
canopy at second base.
807
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:22,919
Christ, what a mob!
808
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:24,712
Listen to that crowd roar.
809
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:26,297
Everywhere the pope has been today,
810
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:28,633
he's received this type of reception.
811
00:41:28,675 --> 00:41:30,718
As one man put it this afternoon,
812
00:41:30,718 --> 00:41:32,553
"Perhaps we are being undignified,

813
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,597
but this is a special day."
814
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,391
And a special day it has been.
815
00:41:36,432 --> 00:41:39,143
That's a great spot for
my Yamaha commercial.
816
00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:40,103
Ha, ha, hal
817
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:44,732
I'd like to give you a brief summary
of today's historic happenings.
818
00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:47,694
Pope Paul VI arrived at 9:27 A.M...
819
00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:50,905
What is it?
820
00:41:52,615 --> 00:41:53,700
Dizzy.
821
00:41:58,746 --> 00:41:59,747
Hey.
822
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:03,793
No wonder.
823
00:42:04,293 --> 00:42:05,545
All that booze.
824
00:42:06,045 --> 00:42:07,505
Ha, ha.
825
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:09,424
You didn't eat anything all
day before dinner, huh?
826
00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:16,431
Hey.
827
00:42:17,765 --> 00:42:18,891
Hey.
828
00:42:41,831 --> 00:42:43,207
Nice.
829
00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:44,959
Sleep is what you need.
830
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:45,960
A good night's sleep.
831
00:42:47,462 --> 00:42:49,297
We have to make a baby.
832
00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:51,883
Oh, we'll--
we'll do it.
833
00:42:53,342 --> 00:42:55,011
Tomorrow.
There's plenty of time.
834
00:42:56,262 --> 00:42:57,472
Just a nap.
835
00:43:36,177 --> 00:43:37,512
Why are you taking them off?
836
00:43:38,387 --> 00:43:39,680
To make you more comfortable.
837
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,891
I am more comfortable.
838
00:43:42,892 --> 00:43:44,060
Sleep, Ro.
839
00:44:24,767 --> 00:44:26,227
Isn't Hutch coming with us?
840
00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:29,480
Catholics only,
841
00:44:29,522 --> 00:44:32,650
I wish we weren't bound
by these prejudices,
842
00:44:32,692 --> 00:44:34,235
but, unfortunately--
843
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:21,449
Easy, easy.
844
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:23,075
You got her too high.
845
00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:25,786
Typhoon!
Typhoon!
846
00:45:25,828 --> 00:45:28,539
It killed 55 people in London,
847
00:45:28,581 --> 00:45:30,124
and it's heading this way!
848
00:45:37,298 --> 00:45:38,925
You better go down below, miss.
849
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,282
She's awake.
She sees.
850
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:45,741
She don't see.
851
00:46:45,783 --> 00:46:46,909
As long as she ate the mouse,
she can't see nor hear.
852
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:48,202
She's like dead.
Now sing.
853
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,881
I'm sorry to hear
854
00:47:00,881 --> 00:47:01,382
you aren't feeling well.
855
00:47:02,883 --> 00:47:04,385
It's only the mouse bite.
856
00:47:05,594 --> 00:47:07,596
You'd better have your legs tied down
857
00:47:07,638 --> 00:47:09,223
in case of convulsions.
858
00:47:10,516 --> 00:47:11,934
Yes, I suppose so.
859
00:47:13,728 --> 00:47:15,771
There's always a chance it was rabid.
860
00:47:15,813 --> 00:47:17,398
If the music bothers you,
861
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,276
let me know, and I'll have
it stopped.
862
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:22,069
Oh, no, no, no.
863
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:24,739
Please don't change the
program on my account.
864
00:47:25,406 --> 00:47:26,365
Try to sleep.
865
00:47:27,408 --> 00:47:29,285
We'll be waiting up on deck.
866
00:48:07,948 --> 00:48:10,159
This is no dream!
This is really happening!
867
00:48:20,086 --> 00:48:22,838
They tell me you have
been bitten by a mouse.
868
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,925
Yes. That's why I couldn't
come to see you.
869
00:48:25,966 --> 00:48:27,927
That's all right.
870
00:48:27,968 --> 00:48:29,345
We wouldn't want you to
jeopardize your health.
871
00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:34,183
Am I forgiven, Father?
872
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:35,476
Oh, absolutely.
873
00:48:49,532 --> 00:48:51,200
Hey, it's after 9:00.
874
00:48:53,452 --> 00:48:54,495
Uhm.
875
00:48:56,914 --> 00:48:58,249
Five minutes.
876
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,209
I have to be at Alan's at 10:00.
877
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:03,337
Eat out.
878
00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:04,505
Like hell I will.
879
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:16,934
What time is it?
880
00:49:16,976 --> 00:49:18,519
It's 10 after 9:00.
881
00:49:20,813 --> 00:49:22,481
What time did I go to sleep?
882
00:49:22,523 --> 00:49:23,899
You didn't go to sleep.
883
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:26,068
You passed out.
884
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:28,863
From now on you get cocktails or wine,
885
00:49:28,863 --> 00:49:30,364
not cocktails and
wine, hmm?
886
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:33,075
The dreams I had.
887
00:49:37,705 --> 00:49:38,998
Don't yell.
888
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:40,249
I already filed them down.
889
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,045
I didn't want to miss baby night.
890
00:49:45,045 --> 00:49:46,005
A couple of my nails were ragged.
891
00:49:46,046 --> 00:49:47,840
You-- While I was out?
892
00:49:47,882 --> 00:49:50,968
And it was kind of fun, in
a "necrophile” sort of way.
893
00:49:54,138 --> 00:49:57,183
I dreamed someone was raping me.
894
00:49:57,975 --> 00:49:59,852
I don't know, someone inhuman.
895
00:49:59,894 --> 00:50:01,145
Thanks a lot!
896
00:50:04,064 --> 00:50:05,232
What's the matter?
897
00:50:05,274 --> 00:50:06,317
Nothing.
898
00:50:08,777 --> 00:50:10,154
I didn't want to miss the night.
899
00:50:11,238 --> 00:50:13,991
We could've done it this
morning or tonight.
900
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:16,368
Last night wasn't the only split second.
901
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,037
I was a little bit loaded
myself, you know?
902
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:40,809
Oh! Hello there.
Did ya like it?
903
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:42,311
Oh, yes.
904
00:50:42,353 --> 00:50:44,230
I think I put a little too
much cream de cocoa in it.
905
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:45,689
No, no.
It was delicious.
906
00:50:45,731 --> 00:50:46,649
You'll have to give me the recipe.
907
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:49,109
Yeah, love to.
Oh, listen, you going shopping?
908
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:50,444
Do me a teeny favor, will ya?
909
00:50:50,444 --> 00:50:53,072
Get me six eggs, a small instant Sanka.
I'll pay you later.
910
00:50:53,781 --> 00:50:54,949
Right.
Bye-bye.
911
00:50:55,449 --> 00:50:56,450
Ahh.
912
00:51:04,917 --> 00:51:06,502
Don't you think we ought
to talk about it?
913
00:51:06,961 --> 00:51:08,128
About what?
914
00:51:09,171 --> 00:51:10,673
The way you haven't been looking at me.
915
00:51:10,714 --> 00:51:11,882
What are you talking about?
916
00:51:11,924 --> 00:51:12,883
I've been looking at you.
917
00:51:12,925 --> 00:51:14,385
You haven't.
918
00:51:14,426 --> 00:51:15,511
Why, sure, I have.
919
00:51:16,387 --> 00:51:17,513
Now, what is it?
What's the matter?
920
00:51:20,975 --> 00:51:22,726
Nothing. Never mind.
921
00:51:22,768 --> 00:51:23,477
No, no.
Don't say that.
922
00:51:23,477 --> 00:51:23,811
What is it?
923
00:51:23,852 --> 00:51:26,480
Nothing.
924
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,399
Look, honey, I--
925
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,609
I know I've been preoccupied
with the part and all,
926
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:32,152
but it is important.
927
00:51:32,152 --> 00:51:33,612
That doesn't mean I don't love you.
928
00:51:48,794 --> 00:51:50,254
It was due on Friday.
929
00:51:52,298 --> 00:51:53,340
It was?
930
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,550
Mm-hmm.
931
00:51:55,884 --> 00:51:57,428
It'll probably come tonight or tomorrow.
932
00:51:57,469 --> 00:51:59,096
Wanna bet?
Yeah.
933
00:51:59,138 --> 00:52:00,180
A quarter.
Okay.
934
00:52:00,222 --> 00:52:01,599
You're going to lose.
935
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,143
Shut up, will you?
You're getting me all jumpy.
936
00:52:04,184 --> 00:52:06,020
It's only been two days.
937
00:52:06,478 --> 00:52:07,396
When will I know?
938
00:52:08,522 --> 00:52:10,816
I'll call you just as soon
as I get the results.
939
00:52:10,858 --> 00:52:12,568
I like to do a general examination
940
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:14,320
just to know something more.
941
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,866
It was Elise Dunstan who recommended
you to me, Doctor.
942
00:52:18,907 --> 00:52:20,409
Oh, yes.
How is she?
943
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:22,620
She's fine.
And the boys are great.
944
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,704
Did you deliver them?
945
00:52:23,746 --> 00:52:25,289
No, just the last.
946
00:52:25,331 --> 00:52:26,540
Universal hemoglobin.
947
00:52:26,582 --> 00:52:28,125
Yes, Doctor.
948
00:52:41,513 --> 00:52:42,931
We went to see The Fantasticks.
949
00:52:42,973 --> 00:52:44,183
Did you?
950
00:52:44,224 --> 00:52:45,559
Mmm.
Did you enjoy it?
951
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:46,769
Yeah.
952
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,062
Good.
953
00:52:53,776 --> 00:52:55,069
Hello?
954
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,236
Mrs. Woodhouse?
955
00:52:56,236 --> 00:52:58,072
Dr. Hill?
Congratulations.
956
00:52:58,572 --> 00:52:59,740
Really?
957
00:52:59,782 --> 00:53:01,033
Really.
958
00:53:03,035 --> 00:53:04,411
Are you there?
959
00:53:04,411 --> 00:53:07,790
Uh, yes, um, what happens now?
960
00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:09,541
You come see me next month.
961
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:12,044
You get those natalin pills.
One a day.
962
00:53:12,086 --> 00:53:13,712
I'll mail you forms for the hospital.
963
00:53:13,754 --> 00:53:15,714
Uh, when will it be?
964
00:53:15,756 --> 00:53:18,092
It works out to be June 28th.
965
00:53:18,092 --> 00:53:19,927
That sounds so far away.
966
00:53:19,927 --> 00:53:21,512
Itis.
967
00:53:21,553 --> 00:53:22,888
One more thing, Mrs. Woodhouse,
968
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,306
we'd like another blood sample.
969
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:25,974
Oh, yes, of course.
970
00:53:26,016 --> 00:53:27,893
What for?
971
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,895
The nurse didn't take enough,
972
00:53:29,937 --> 00:53:31,355
so would you drop by and see her?
973
00:53:31,397 --> 00:53:33,857
But I am pregnant, aren't I?
974
00:53:33,899 --> 00:53:35,109
Oh, yes, it's just for blood samp--
975
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,777
Blood sugar and so forth.
976
00:53:36,819 --> 00:53:39,363
But you're pregnant.
Don't worry.
977
00:53:39,405 --> 00:53:42,116
All right.
Well, I'll come in on Monday.
978
00:53:42,116 --> 00:53:43,367
All right.
Don't forget the pills.
979
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:44,618
No, I won't.
980
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,245
Good-bye, Mrs. Woodhouse.
Good-bye, Dr. Hill.
981
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:49,790
Blood sugar?
982
00:54:06,682 --> 00:54:07,558
What's that?
983
00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:14,148
Oh! That's great.
That's just great.
984
00:54:14,815 --> 00:54:15,983
Father.
985
00:54:15,983 --> 00:54:17,818
Mother.
Heh, heh.
986
00:54:18,819 --> 00:54:21,488
Guy, Guy, listen.
987
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:24,658
Let's, uh, make this
a new beginning, okay?
988
00:54:24,658 --> 00:54:26,452
A new openness in talking to each other,
989
00:54:26,493 --> 00:54:28,829
because we haven't been open.
990
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:32,291
That's true.
I've been so goddamned self-centered.
991
00:54:32,332 --> 00:54:34,251
That's what the whole trouble is.
992
00:54:34,293 --> 00:54:35,878
You know I love you, don't you, Ro?
993
00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:37,337
I do.
I swear to God
994
00:54:37,379 --> 00:54:38,964
I'm going to be as open and--
995
00:54:39,006 --> 00:54:40,174
It's my fault as much as yours.
996
00:54:40,174 --> 00:54:42,092
No, bull, it's mine.
Now you bear with me.
997
00:54:42,134 --> 00:54:43,635
I'm gonna try and do better, you hear?
998
00:54:43,677 --> 00:54:45,304
Oh, Guy.
999
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,772
Ha, ha, ha.
1000
00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:56,356
What?
1001
00:54:56,398 --> 00:54:57,691
It's...
1002
00:54:57,733 --> 00:55:00,652
a fine way for parents
to be carrying on.
1003
00:55:00,694 --> 00:55:02,488
Hey.
1004
00:55:02,529 --> 00:55:03,781
Know what I'd love to do?
1005
00:55:03,822 --> 00:55:05,282
What?
1006
00:55:05,324 --> 00:55:06,992
Tell Minnie and Roman.
1007
00:55:07,034 --> 00:55:08,619
Oh, I know, I know.
1008
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,579
It's, uh--
1009
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:13,165
It's, uh, supposed to be
a deep, dark secret,
1010
00:55:13,207 --> 00:55:16,668
but I already told them
that we were trying.
1011
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:17,795
They were so pleased.
1012
00:55:19,171 --> 00:55:20,881
Tell them.
1013
00:55:20,923 --> 00:55:22,049
Back in two minutes?
1014
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,342
Mm-hmm.
1015
00:55:33,894 --> 00:55:35,395
You're pregnant.
1016
00:55:38,857 --> 00:55:39,733
Another blood sample.
1017
00:55:40,067 --> 00:55:41,443
Ta-da!
1018
00:55:41,485 --> 00:55:44,863
Now, that's what I call good news!
1019
00:55:44,905 --> 00:55:47,658
Aw, honey, congratulations.
1020
00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:49,243
Thank you.
1021
00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:50,744
Best wishes, Rosemary.
1022
00:55:50,744 --> 00:55:52,037
Thank you very much.
1023
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,539
We are more pleased than we can say.
1024
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,165
We didn't have any champagne on hand,
1025
00:55:55,207 --> 00:55:56,708
but this will do just as nicely.
1026
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,210
When are you due, dear?
1027
00:55:58,585 --> 00:55:59,920
June 28th.
1028
00:55:59,962 --> 00:56:01,421
Oh, that'll be so exciting.
1029
00:56:01,463 --> 00:56:02,798
Listen, dear, you got a good doctor?
1030
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,299
Oh, yes, a very good one.
1031
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:06,134
One of the top obstetricians
1032
00:56:06,176 --> 00:56:08,053
is a dear friend of
ours, Abe Sapirstein.
1033
00:56:08,095 --> 00:56:09,888
Delivers all the society babies.
1034
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,306
Abe Sapirstein?
1035
00:56:11,348 --> 00:56:13,600
One of the finest obstetricians
in the country.
1036
00:56:13,642 --> 00:56:15,269
Wasn't he on Open End
a couple of years ago?
1037
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,770
That's right.
1038
00:56:16,812 --> 00:56:17,896
Ro?
1039
00:56:17,938 --> 00:56:19,356
Uh--
1040
00:56:19,398 --> 00:56:21,191
Well, what about Dr. Hill?
1041
00:56:21,233 --> 00:56:22,818
Don't worry about Hill.
I'll tell him something.
1042
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,361
You know me.
1043
00:56:24,403 --> 00:56:26,196
Listen, I won't let you
go to no Dr. Hill
1044
00:56:26,238 --> 00:56:27,531
nobody ever heard of.
1045
00:56:27,573 --> 00:56:29,908
The best is what you're going
to have, young lady.
1046
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,243
Where's your telephone, huh?
1047
00:56:31,285 --> 00:56:32,744
It's in the bedroom.
1048
00:56:32,786 --> 00:56:35,289
He's a brilliant man.
Very sensitive.
1049
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:37,082
Ro, sit down, sit down.
1050
00:56:37,124 --> 00:56:38,542
No, I'm fine.
1051
00:56:38,584 --> 00:56:41,336
Abe, Minnie.
Fine.
1052
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:42,671
Listen, Abe, a dear friend of ours
1053
00:56:42,713 --> 00:56:44,923
Just found out today she's pregnant.
1054
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:46,675
Yeah, isn't it?
I'm in her apartment right now.
1055
00:56:47,759 --> 00:56:50,095
We told her you'd be glad
to take care of her.
1056
00:56:50,137 --> 00:56:52,598
You wouldn't charge her none of your
fancy society prices neither.
1057
00:56:53,307 --> 00:56:55,309
Well, just wait a minute.
1058
00:56:55,309 --> 00:56:56,560
Rosemary, tomorrow morning at 11:00?
1059
00:56:56,977 --> 00:56:58,353
All right.
1060
00:56:58,395 --> 00:57:00,856
Yeah, 11:00's fine, Abe.
Uh-huh.
1061
00:57:00,898 --> 00:57:02,900
Yeah, well, you, too.
1062
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:05,193
No, no, no, no, not at all.
1063
00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:06,820
All right.
Well, let's hope so.
1064
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,571
Good-bye.
1065
00:57:08,155 --> 00:57:10,282
Well, there you are.
1066
00:57:10,324 --> 00:57:11,575
Thanks a million, Minnie.
1067
00:57:11,617 --> 00:57:13,785
I don't know how to thank
you, both of you.
1068
00:57:13,827 --> 00:57:16,371
Just have a fine, healthy
baby, that's all.
1069
00:57:16,413 --> 00:57:19,207
My, I can't wait to tell Laura-Louise.
1070
00:57:19,249 --> 00:57:21,335
Oh--
1071
00:57:21,376 --> 00:57:24,087
Uh, please don't tell anyone
else, not right away.
1072
00:57:24,129 --> 00:57:25,380
No, she's right.
1073
00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:27,174
There's plenty of time.
1074
00:57:27,174 --> 00:57:29,760
Now, to a fine, healthy baby.
1075
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:30,802
Hear, hear.
1076
00:57:30,844 --> 00:57:31,845
Hear!
1077
00:57:33,555 --> 00:57:34,848
Andy.
1078
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:38,852
Or Susan.
1079
00:57:40,187 --> 00:57:41,688
Susan.
1080
00:58:27,526 --> 00:58:30,320
Please don't read books.
1081
00:58:30,362 --> 00:58:33,407
No pregnancy was ever exactly like
the ones described in the books.
1082
00:58:34,616 --> 00:58:37,327
And don't listen to
your friends, either.
1083
00:58:37,369 --> 00:58:38,996
No two pregnancies are ever alike.
1084
00:58:40,664 --> 00:58:42,416
Dr. Hill prescribed vitamin pills.
1085
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:44,251
No pills.
1086
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:47,421
Minnie Castevet has a herbarium.
1087
00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:49,006
I'm going to have her make
a daily drink for you
1088
00:58:49,047 --> 00:58:51,550
that'll be fresher, safer,
and more vitamin-rich
1089
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:52,843
than any pills on the market.
1090
00:58:55,053 --> 00:58:57,764
Any questions you have,
call me night or day.
1091
00:58:57,806 --> 00:58:59,349
Call me, not your Aunt Fanny.
1092
00:58:59,391 --> 00:59:00,267
That's what I'm here for.
1093
00:59:00,308 --> 00:59:01,977
Here.
1094
00:59:02,019 --> 00:59:03,437
What's in it?
1095
00:59:03,478 --> 00:59:06,565
Snips and snails and puppy dogs" tails.
1096
00:59:06,606 --> 00:59:08,316
That's fine, but what if we
want a girl?
1097
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:10,527
Do you?
1098
00:59:10,569 --> 00:59:12,320
It would be nice if the
first one were a boy.
1099
00:59:12,362 --> 00:59:13,947
Well, there you are.
1100
00:59:17,325 --> 00:59:19,036
No, really, what is
init?
1101
00:59:19,077 --> 00:59:21,455
A raw egg, gelatin, herbs.
1102
00:59:21,496 --> 00:59:23,373
Tannis root?
1103
00:59:23,415 --> 00:59:26,126
Some of that along with
some other things.
1104
00:59:26,168 --> 00:59:29,171
Don't be so violent, Harry.
If you want to be stupid,
1105
00:59:29,212 --> 00:59:30,922
be nonviolent stupid,
1106
00:59:31,631 --> 00:59:33,216
I'm in love with no one.
1107
00:59:33,258 --> 00:59:34,634
Especially not your fat wife.
1108
00:59:35,635 --> 00:59:37,137
I'm a hopeless cripple--
1109
00:59:39,473 --> 00:59:40,599
What's that?
1110
00:59:42,225 --> 00:59:44,478
I-I've been to Vidal Sassoon.
1111
00:59:45,312 --> 00:59:46,688
Don't tell me you paid for that.
1112
00:59:48,482 --> 00:59:50,942
Guy, I have a pain.
1113
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:52,652
Where?
1114
00:59:52,652 --> 00:59:54,029
Here.
1115
00:59:54,071 --> 00:59:55,197
Just now?
1116
00:59:55,238 --> 00:59:56,531
Since Monday.
1117
00:59:57,199 --> 00:59:58,533
A sharp pain.
1118
00:59:58,575 --> 01:00:00,118
Did you see Sapirstein?
1119
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,328
I'm seeing him on Wednesday.
1120
01:00:01,328 --> 01:00:02,496
This is ridiculous.
1121
01:00:02,537 --> 01:00:04,372
Why don't you see Sapirstein?
1122
01:00:04,414 --> 01:00:05,540
Why didn't you say anything?
1123
01:00:05,582 --> 01:00:06,875
I see him Wednesday regular.
1124
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,712
An entirely natural expansion
of the pelvis.
1125
01:00:10,754 --> 01:00:12,464
You can fight it with ordinary aspirin.
1126
01:00:12,506 --> 01:00:14,800
I was afraid it might be
an ectopic pregnancy.
1127
01:00:15,133 --> 01:00:17,052
Ectopic?
1128
01:00:17,094 --> 01:00:18,970
I thought you weren't going
to read books, Rosemary.
1129
01:00:19,012 --> 01:00:20,680
It was staring at me in the drugstore.
1130
01:00:20,722 --> 01:00:22,140
All it did was worry you.
1131
01:00:22,182 --> 01:00:24,351
Will you go home and
throw it away, please?
1132
01:00:24,392 --> 01:00:26,186
The pains will be gone in two days.
1133
01:00:27,521 --> 01:00:29,064
Ectopic pregnancy.
1134
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:14,818
I look awful.
1135
01:01:15,902 --> 01:01:17,320
What are you talking about?
1136
01:01:17,362 --> 01:01:19,406
You look great.
1137
01:01:19,406 --> 01:01:20,824
It's that haircut that looks awful.
1138
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,493
You want the truth, honey,
1139
01:01:23,535 --> 01:01:25,078
that's the worst mistake you ever made.
1140
01:02:00,363 --> 01:02:02,157
My Goa!
1141
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:03,950
It's Vidal Sassoon.
1142
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,118
It's very in.
1143
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,703
What's wrong with you?
1144
01:02:06,745 --> 01:02:08,330
Do I look that bad?
1145
01:02:08,371 --> 01:02:09,956
Terrible!
1146
01:02:09,998 --> 01:02:11,791
You're not on one of those
Zen diets, are you?
1147
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,126
No.
1148
01:02:13,126 --> 01:02:15,128
Then what is it?
Have you seen a doctor?
1149
01:02:16,296 --> 01:02:17,505
Hutch, I might as well tell you.
1150
01:02:17,547 --> 01:02:18,632
I'm pregnant.
1151
01:02:18,673 --> 01:02:20,634
Oh, rubbish.
1152
01:02:20,634 --> 01:02:23,386
Pregnant women gain weight.
They don't lose it.
1153
01:02:23,428 --> 01:02:25,180
I don't sleep well.
1154
01:02:25,222 --> 01:02:28,141
I have stiff joints or something,
so I get a pain.
1155
01:02:28,183 --> 01:02:29,768
Nothing serious.
1156
01:02:29,809 --> 01:02:31,603
Well, congratulations.
1157
01:02:32,312 --> 01:02:33,396
You must be very happy.
1158
01:02:33,438 --> 01:02:35,148
Oh, I am.
We both are.
1159
01:02:36,149 --> 01:02:38,151
Who's your obstetrician?
1160
01:02:38,151 --> 01:02:39,861
Abraham Sapirstein.
1161
01:02:39,903 --> 01:02:42,822
Oh! He delivered two of
my daughter's babies.
1162
01:02:42,822 --> 01:02:44,699
He's one of the best in the city.
1163
01:02:44,741 --> 01:02:46,076
When did you see him last?
1164
01:02:46,117 --> 01:02:47,535
Um, yesterday.
1165
01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:48,912
And?
1166
01:02:48,954 --> 01:02:50,664
And he says it's fairly common.
1167
01:02:52,332 --> 01:02:53,833
How much weight have you lost?
1168
01:02:55,335 --> 01:02:57,087
Uh, 3 pounds.
1169
01:02:57,128 --> 01:02:59,005
Nonsense. You've lost
far more than that.
1170
01:03:00,215 --> 01:03:02,509
It's perfectly normal to
lose a little at first.
1171
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:04,135
Later on, I'll be gaining.
1172
01:03:04,177 --> 01:03:06,763
Well...
1173
01:03:06,805 --> 01:03:09,683
we must assume Dr. Sapirstein
knows whereof he speaks.
1174
01:03:09,683 --> 01:03:11,601
He should.
He charges enough.
1175
01:03:11,643 --> 01:03:13,520
We're getting bargain rates.
1176
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,771
Our neighbors are close friends of his.
1177
01:03:14,813 --> 01:03:16,189
Oh?
1178
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:17,857
I'll go.
Stay where you are.
1179
01:03:17,899 --> 01:03:19,276
It hurts less when I move around.
1180
01:03:22,862 --> 01:03:24,614
Oh, I was just talking about you.
1181
01:03:24,698 --> 01:03:26,032
Favorably, I hope.
1182
01:03:26,032 --> 01:03:27,784
Do you need anything from outside?
1183
01:03:27,826 --> 01:03:29,494
No. Thank you for asking.
1184
01:03:29,536 --> 01:03:31,413
Is Guy home already?
1185
01:03:31,454 --> 01:03:32,872
He won't be home till 6:00.
1186
01:03:32,914 --> 01:03:34,249
Oh.
1187
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:35,709
A friend of ours is here.
1188
01:03:37,043 --> 01:03:38,628
Would you--
Would you like to meet him?
1189
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:40,422
If I won't be intruding.
1190
01:03:40,463 --> 01:03:41,881
No. Please come in.
1191
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,438
Hutch, this is Roman Castevet.
1192
01:03:56,479 --> 01:03:57,939
Edward Hutchins.
1193
01:03:57,981 --> 01:03:59,899
How do you do?
Oh, how are you, sir?
1194
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:01,735
I was just telling Hutch
that it was you and Minnie
1195
01:04:01,735 --> 01:04:03,111
who sent me to Dr. Sapirstein.
1196
01:04:03,153 --> 01:04:05,405
Oh, so Rosemary has told
you the good news.
1197
01:04:05,405 --> 01:04:06,781
Yes, she has.
1198
01:04:06,823 --> 01:04:08,575
We must see that she
gets plenty of rest.
1199
01:04:08,616 --> 01:04:10,452
I was a bit alarmed by her appearance.
1200
01:04:10,493 --> 01:04:12,162
Well, she has lost some weight,
1201
01:04:12,203 --> 01:04:14,247
but that's quite normal
for the early months.
1202
01:04:14,247 --> 01:04:16,916
Later on, she'll gain,
probably far too much.
1203
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:19,919
So I gather.
Please sit down.
1204
01:04:19,961 --> 01:04:22,589
Mrs. Castevet makes a vitamin
drink for me every day
1205
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:24,257
from fresh herbs she grows.
1206
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:27,093
Yes, all according to Dr. Sapirstein's
directions, of course.
1207
01:04:27,093 --> 01:04:29,054
He's inclined to be suspicious
1208
01:04:29,095 --> 01:04:31,514
of commercially prepared vitamin pills.
1209
01:04:31,556 --> 01:04:33,933
Indeed? But surely they're manufactured
1210
01:04:33,933 --> 01:04:35,727
under every imaginable safeguard.
1211
01:04:35,769 --> 01:04:38,104
That's quite true, but commercial pills
1212
01:04:38,146 --> 01:04:40,148
can sit for months on a druggist's shelf
1213
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:42,609
and lose a great deal of
their original potency.
1214
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,110
I hadn't thought of that.
1215
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:47,113
I like the idea of having everything
fresh and natural.
1216
01:04:47,155 --> 01:04:50,241
I'll bet expectant mothers
chewed bits of tannis root
1217
01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:52,118
when nobody'd even heard
of vitamin pills.
1218
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,661
Tannis root?
1219
01:04:53,703 --> 01:04:55,955
It's one of the herbs
she puts in the drink.
1220
01:04:55,955 --> 01:04:57,999
Oris it an herb?
Can a root be an herb?
1221
01:04:58,041 --> 01:05:00,502
You sure you don't mean
anise or orris root?
1222
01:05:00,543 --> 01:05:01,628
No, tannis.
1223
01:05:01,628 --> 01:05:03,004
Hmm.
1224
01:05:03,755 --> 01:05:05,298
Look.
1225
01:05:06,966 --> 01:05:08,468
It's good luck, too.
1226
01:05:09,636 --> 01:05:10,804
Ish!
1227
01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:13,056
Ha.
1228
01:05:13,973 --> 01:05:16,309
Doesn't look like, uh, root matter,
1229
01:05:16,351 --> 01:05:18,978
more like mold or fungus of some kind.
1230
01:05:21,022 --> 01:05:22,399
Is it ever called by any other name?
1231
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,942
Not to my knowledge, no.
1232
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:29,531
Tannis. I must look it up
in the encyclopedia.
1233
01:05:29,572 --> 01:05:31,950
What a pretty holder or
charm or whatever it is.
1234
01:05:31,991 --> 01:05:33,910
The Castevets gave it to me.
1235
01:05:33,952 --> 01:05:35,245
You and your wife
1236
01:05:35,286 --> 01:05:36,538
seem to be taking better
care of Rosemary
1237
01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:37,872
than her own parents.
1238
01:05:37,914 --> 01:05:40,250
We're very fond of her.
And of Guy, too.
1239
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:42,544
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll have to go.
1240
01:05:42,585 --> 01:05:44,045
My wife is waiting for me.
1241
01:05:44,087 --> 01:05:45,630
It's a pleasure to have met you.
1242
01:05:45,672 --> 01:05:47,549
Oh, don't bother, Rosemary.
1243
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,175
We'll meet again, I'm sure.
1244
01:05:52,345 --> 01:05:54,848
I just noticed he has pierced ears.
1245
01:05:54,889 --> 01:05:57,892
Pierced ears and piercing eyes.
1246
01:05:57,934 --> 01:05:59,394
What's she like?
1247
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:02,230
Nosy. Funny.
1248
01:06:03,189 --> 01:06:05,191
Guy's gotten very close to them.
1249
01:06:05,233 --> 01:06:07,944
I suppose they've become sort
of parent figures for him.
1250
01:06:10,655 --> 01:06:12,699
And you?
1251
01:06:14,659 --> 01:06:17,537
Sometimes I think they're
too friendly and helpful.
1252
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,707
Hey, what a surprise.
1253
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:22,000
How are you, Hutch?
Good to see you.
1254
01:06:22,041 --> 01:06:23,376
You're the surprise.
What happened?
1255
01:06:23,418 --> 01:06:25,420
They stopped for a rewrite,
those dumb bastards.
1256
01:06:26,296 --> 01:06:28,631
Ah, stay where you are.
Nobody move.
1257
01:06:28,673 --> 01:06:30,216
Would you like some coffee?
1258
01:06:30,216 --> 01:06:31,426
Love some.
1259
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:39,017
Loot!
1260
01:06:39,058 --> 01:06:40,768
Seems congratulations are in order.
1261
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:41,853
Yeah, it's wonderful, isn't it?
1262
01:06:41,895 --> 01:06:43,104
When's the baby due?
1263
01:06:43,146 --> 01:06:44,898
June 28th.
1264
01:06:44,898 --> 01:06:46,191
Did you know that Dr. Sapirstein
1265
01:06:46,232 --> 01:06:48,401
delivered two of Hutch's grandchildren?
1266
01:06:48,401 --> 01:06:49,819
Really?
Mmm.
1267
01:06:49,861 --> 01:06:51,821
I met your neighbor.
1268
01:06:51,863 --> 01:06:54,199
Roman Castevet.
Oh, did you?
1269
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,408
Funny old duck, isn't he?
1270
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:57,410
Did you ever notice he has pierced ears?
1271
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:59,996
You're kidding.
No, I'm not. I saw.
1272
01:07:00,038 --> 01:07:01,831
It's a shame we haven't
seen more of you lately,
1273
01:07:01,873 --> 01:07:03,875
but with me being so busy
1274
01:07:03,917 --> 01:07:05,251
and Ro being the way she is,
1275
01:07:05,293 --> 01:07:06,503
we really haven't seen anyone.
1276
01:07:06,544 --> 01:07:07,921
Perhaps we can have
dinner together soon.
1277
01:07:07,962 --> 01:07:09,214
You're not going, are you?
1278
01:07:09,255 --> 01:07:10,590
Thanks for the coffee, my dear.
1279
01:07:10,632 --> 01:07:12,300
Thank you for coming, my dear.
1280
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:18,932
This isn't mine.
It must be yours.
1281
01:07:18,973 --> 01:07:20,600
Right you are.
1282
01:07:20,642 --> 01:07:23,144
Have you thought about names,
or is it too soon?
1283
01:07:23,186 --> 01:07:25,063
Andrew or Douglas if it's a boy,
1284
01:07:25,104 --> 01:07:26,731
Melinda or Sarah if it's a girl.
1285
01:07:26,773 --> 01:07:28,274
Sarah?
What happened to Susan?
1286
01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:30,318
Say, is there another of these around?
1287
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,653
Oh.
1288
01:07:35,782 --> 01:07:37,617
I don't see it, Hutch.
1289
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:40,119
No, it's not here.
1290
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:41,829
I probably left it at the city center.
1291
01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:43,414
I'll stop back there.
1292
01:07:43,456 --> 01:07:45,083
Let's really have that dinner, shall we?
1293
01:07:45,124 --> 01:07:46,793
Definitely.
Next week.
1294
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:48,628
Bye.
Bye-bye.
1295
01:07:48,628 --> 01:07:50,255
Bye.
Bye.
1296
01:07:57,804 --> 01:07:59,305
It was a nice surprise.
1297
01:08:00,014 --> 01:08:01,140
Guess what he said.
1298
01:08:02,475 --> 01:08:03,768
What?
1299
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:05,061
I look terrible.
1300
01:08:05,103 --> 01:08:07,313
Good old Hutch.
1301
01:08:07,355 --> 01:08:09,023
He's spreading cheer wherever he goes.
1302
01:08:09,065 --> 01:08:10,483
I'm going to get a paper, honey.
1303
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:14,404
He's a professional crepehanger.
1304
01:08:14,445 --> 01:08:15,947
He's not a professional crepehanger.
1305
01:08:15,989 --> 01:08:18,032
Then he's one of the
top-ranking amateurs.
1306
01:08:29,752 --> 01:08:31,170
Hello.
1307
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:33,548
Oh, uh, she's not feeling too well.
1308
01:08:34,966 --> 01:08:36,050
Well, I think she's asleep.
1309
01:08:36,551 --> 01:08:37,552
All right.
1310
01:08:39,262 --> 01:08:40,680
Oh, she could be, yeah.
1311
01:08:42,849 --> 01:08:43,975
All right, can you hold on a minute?
1312
01:08:48,104 --> 01:08:49,188
It's Hutch.
He wants to speak to you.
1313
01:08:49,689 --> 01:08:50,690
Oh.
1314
01:08:51,858 --> 01:08:53,067
I told him you were resting,
1315
01:08:53,109 --> 01:08:54,152
but he said he couldn't wait.
1316
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:03,244
Hutch?
1317
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:05,038
Tell me, dear, do you go out at all?
1318
01:09:05,872 --> 01:09:09,459
Well, I-I haven't been going out. Why?
1319
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,377
Can you meet me tomorrow
morning at 11:00
1320
01:09:11,377 --> 01:09:13,046
in front of the Time-Life building?
1321
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:15,757
Yes, if you want me to.
1322
01:09:15,798 --> 01:09:17,383
What is it?
Can't you tell me now?
1323
01:09:17,425 --> 01:09:18,843
I'd rather not.
1324
01:09:18,885 --> 01:09:20,720
We can have an early lunch if you like.
1325
01:09:20,762 --> 01:09:22,221
That would be nice.
1326
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:24,140
Good. 11:00 then?
Okay.
1327
01:09:24,182 --> 01:09:25,808
Oh, did you find your glove?
1328
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:27,226
No, they didn't have it.
1329
01:09:27,268 --> 01:09:28,770
Good night, Rosemary.
Sleep well.
1330
01:09:28,811 --> 01:09:30,313
You, too. Good night.
1331
01:09:30,855 --> 01:09:32,273
What was that?
1332
01:09:32,315 --> 01:09:33,441
He wants to talk to me.
1333
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,234
What about?
1334
01:09:35,234 --> 01:09:36,569
I don't know.
He wouldn't say.
1335
01:09:37,904 --> 01:09:40,406
I think those boys' adventure
stories are going to his head.
1336
01:09:43,743 --> 01:09:45,328
Where are you meeting him?
1337
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:48,414
Uh, Time and Life building
tomorrow at 11:00.
1338
01:09:51,584 --> 01:09:53,544
This is ridiculous.
1339
01:09:53,586 --> 01:09:55,296
You're pregnant.
I've got the yens.
1340
01:09:55,338 --> 01:09:56,255
I'm getting an ice-cream cone.
You want one?
1341
01:09:56,839 --> 01:09:57,882
Yeah, I'd love one.
1342
01:09:57,924 --> 01:09:59,008
Vanilla?
1343
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:00,677
Okay.
Okay.
1344
01:10:22,865 --> 01:10:24,242
Hi.
1345
01:10:24,283 --> 01:10:25,952
Minnie, I'm going out now,
1346
01:10:25,952 --> 01:10:27,453
so I won't have my drink at 11:00.
1347
01:10:27,453 --> 01:10:29,288
That's fine, dear.
Take it later.
1348
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:30,748
Buzz me when you get back, huh?
1349
01:10:58,693 --> 01:11:01,237
Pain, begone.
I will have no more of thee.
1350
01:11:37,523 --> 01:11:39,066
Yes?
1351
01:11:39,108 --> 01:11:40,777
Is this Edward Hutchins' apartment?
1352
01:11:40,818 --> 01:11:42,111
Yes. Who is this, please?
1353
01:11:42,153 --> 01:11:43,654
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.
1354
01:11:43,696 --> 01:11:45,198
I had an appointment with Mr. Hutchins.
1355
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:46,491
Is he there?
1356
01:11:47,825 --> 01:11:49,118
Hello?
1357
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,495
He was taken ill this morning.
1358
01:11:51,913 --> 01:11:54,707
Taken ill?
Yes.
1359
01:11:54,749 --> 01:11:56,876
He's in a deep coma at
St. Vincent's hospital.
1360
01:11:57,877 --> 01:11:59,295
That's awful.
1361
01:11:59,337 --> 01:12:03,216
I just spoke to him
last night about 10:30.
1362
01:12:03,257 --> 01:12:04,884
I spoke to him at 11:00.
1363
01:12:04,884 --> 01:12:06,511
Who is this?
1364
01:12:06,552 --> 01:12:08,137
You don't know me, Rosemary.
1365
01:12:08,179 --> 01:12:10,389
I'm Grace Cardiff, Hutch's friend.
1366
01:12:10,389 --> 01:12:13,059
Um, do they know what's causing it?
1367
01:12:13,059 --> 01:12:14,811
No, they don't know yet.
1368
01:12:14,852 --> 01:12:16,771
At the moment, he's
totally unresponsive.
1369
01:12:18,147 --> 01:12:20,149
Oh, I'm going to the hospital now.
1370
01:12:20,191 --> 01:12:21,567
Is there anything I can do?
1371
01:12:21,567 --> 01:12:22,777
Not really.
1372
01:12:24,278 --> 01:12:25,863
All right, um, thank you.
1373
01:12:54,183 --> 01:12:56,018
No!
1374
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:59,063
This is what I call the
long arm of coincidence!
1375
01:12:59,105 --> 01:13:01,524
Ho, ho, ho!
1376
01:13:01,566 --> 01:13:04,610
I said to myself, as long
as Rosemary's going out,
1377
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:07,280
I might as well go out and do a
little bit of Christmas shopping.
1378
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,156
Now here you are.
Here I am.
1379
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:11,367
Isn't that something?
1380
01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:13,828
Aw, darling, what's the matter?
You feel all right?
1381
01:13:15,288 --> 01:13:19,125
Aw... aw, you poor thing.
1382
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:20,459
You know what I think?
1383
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:22,128
I think we better be going home now.
1384
01:13:22,169 --> 01:13:23,546
What do you say?
1385
01:13:23,588 --> 01:13:25,590
No, no, you have your shopping to do.
1386
01:13:25,631 --> 01:13:27,341
Ah, shoot, there's two more weeks.
1387
01:13:44,525 --> 01:13:46,277
It'll stop any day now.
1388
01:13:47,153 --> 01:13:48,654
It's like a wire inside me
1389
01:13:48,654 --> 01:13:50,531
getting tighter and tighter.
1390
01:13:50,573 --> 01:13:53,534
Usually older women with
less flexible joints
1391
01:13:53,576 --> 01:13:54,660
have this sort of trouble.
1392
01:13:55,369 --> 01:13:56,829
I'm not going out anymore.
1393
01:13:56,829 --> 01:13:57,997
You don't have to.
1394
01:13:58,039 --> 01:13:59,999
One minute to go!
1395
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:04,170
Rosemary, I want you to meet Dr. Shand.
1396
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:06,172
He used to be a famous dentist.
1397
01:14:06,172 --> 01:14:08,174
He made the chain for your charm.
1398
01:14:08,174 --> 01:14:09,800
Oh, how do you do?
1399
01:14:09,842 --> 01:14:11,093
Come on, sweetie.
1400
01:14:11,135 --> 01:14:12,511
Put this wonderful hat on.
1401
01:14:13,054 --> 01:14:15,014
Doctor, come over here.
1402
01:14:15,056 --> 01:14:16,307
Minnie, Minnie.
1403
01:14:16,349 --> 01:14:17,892
Happy new year.
1404
01:14:17,934 --> 01:14:19,352
Have a good year.
1405
01:14:19,352 --> 01:14:21,354
Happy new year.
1406
01:14:23,606 --> 01:14:25,983
To 1966!
1407
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:27,777
The year 1!
1408
01:15:21,038 --> 01:15:22,081
What the hell are you doing?
1409
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,083
Planning the menu.
1410
01:15:25,668 --> 01:15:27,461
We're having a party
a week from Saturday.
1411
01:15:29,005 --> 01:15:30,297
It's for our old--
1412
01:15:30,339 --> 01:15:31,757
I mean, our young friends.
1413
01:15:31,799 --> 01:15:33,884
Minnie and Roman are not invited.
1414
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,429
Neither is Laura-Louise.
1415
01:15:36,429 --> 01:15:38,222
Nor is Dr. Sapirstein.
1416
01:15:38,264 --> 01:15:39,640
It's going to be a very special party.
1417
01:15:39,682 --> 01:15:41,017
You have to be under 60 to get in.
1418
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:50,234
Well.
1419
01:15:50,276 --> 01:15:52,445
For a minute there, I didn't
think I was going to make it.
1420
01:15:52,486 --> 01:15:53,571
You'll make it, all right.
1421
01:15:53,612 --> 01:15:55,823
You can be bartender.
1422
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:57,033
Oh, swell.
1423
01:15:58,617 --> 01:16:00,578
Do you really think it's
such a good idea?
1424
01:16:00,619 --> 01:16:03,205
I think it's the best idea
I've had in months.
1425
01:16:03,247 --> 01:16:04,373
Don't you think you ought to check
1426
01:16:04,415 --> 01:16:05,875
with Dr. Sapirstein first?
1427
01:16:05,916 --> 01:16:08,044
What for? I'm just giving a party.
1428
01:16:08,085 --> 01:16:09,962
I'm not going to swim
the English Channel.
1429
01:16:09,962 --> 01:16:11,005
What about the pain?
1430
01:16:13,132 --> 01:16:14,383
Oh, haven't you heard?
1431
01:16:14,425 --> 01:16:16,969
It'll go away in a day or two.
1432
01:16:17,011 --> 01:16:18,763
That looks interesting.
1433
01:16:18,763 --> 01:16:19,638
What's it for?
1434
01:16:19,638 --> 01:16:21,724
We're having some people
over on Saturday.
1435
01:16:21,766 --> 01:16:23,809
Oh, you feel up to entertaining?
1436
01:16:23,809 --> 01:16:25,770
Yes, I do.
These are old friends
1437
01:16:25,811 --> 01:16:27,480
I haven't seen in a long time.
1438
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:29,482
They don't even know yet
that I'm pregnant.
1439
01:16:29,523 --> 01:16:30,733
I'll give you a hand if you like.
1440
01:16:30,775 --> 01:16:32,318
I'll help you dish things out.
1441
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:34,487
No, thank you, Minnie, but I can manage.
1442
01:16:34,487 --> 01:16:35,905
It's going to be a buffet,
1443
01:16:35,946 --> 01:16:37,573
and we're getting a bartender, so--
1444
01:16:37,615 --> 01:16:39,658
I'll help you take the coats.
1445
01:16:39,658 --> 01:16:42,661
No, really, you do too
much for me as it is.
1446
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,499
Well, let me know if
you change your mind.
1447
01:16:46,499 --> 01:16:47,666
Drink your drink now.
1448
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:51,170
I'd rather not.
1449
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:52,797
Not right this minute.
1450
01:16:52,838 --> 01:16:54,090
I'll drink it in a little while.
1451
01:16:55,216 --> 01:16:56,675
It don't do to let it stand.
1452
01:16:56,675 --> 01:16:58,344
No, I won't wait too long.
1453
01:16:58,344 --> 01:16:59,595
You go on back,
1454
01:16:59,637 --> 01:17:01,180
and I'll bring the glass
back to you later.
1455
01:17:01,222 --> 01:17:03,015
I'll wait.
I'll save you the walk.
1456
01:17:03,015 --> 01:17:05,351
You'll do no such thing.
It makes me very nervous
1457
01:17:05,351 --> 01:17:06,352
when people watch me cook.
1458
01:17:06,352 --> 01:17:07,645
Now, scoot.
1459
01:17:07,686 --> 01:17:09,522
Don't let it stand too long.
1460
01:17:09,563 --> 01:17:10,940
It's going to lose its vitamins.
1461
01:17:22,243 --> 01:17:25,830
You dirty, stinking secret-keeper.
Congratulations!
1462
01:17:25,871 --> 01:17:28,040
Congratulations.
Thank you.
1463
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:29,041
Hey, Rosie.
1464
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:31,001
Yeah?
1465
01:17:31,043 --> 01:17:33,254
Bob and Leo got stuck
at another party, dear,
1466
01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:34,421
but they'll be over right away.
1467
01:17:34,463 --> 01:17:35,631
Oh, fine.
1468
01:17:37,383 --> 01:17:39,635
You're so lucky.
It's a fantastic house.
1469
01:17:40,052 --> 01:17:41,137
Hi.
1470
01:17:43,013 --> 01:17:44,682
It's been so long.
1471
01:17:44,723 --> 01:17:45,975
You look like a piece of chalk.
1472
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:49,770
You make him feed you, love.
1473
01:17:53,732 --> 01:17:54,775
Adrian Marcato lived here.
1474
01:17:54,817 --> 01:17:56,110
And the Trench sisters.
1475
01:17:56,152 --> 01:17:57,403
Trent sisters?
1476
01:17:57,403 --> 01:17:58,654
Trench. They ate little children.
1477
01:17:58,696 --> 01:18:00,656
He doesn't just mean
they ate them.
1478
01:18:00,698 --> 01:18:01,866
He means they ate
them.
1479
01:18:08,914 --> 01:18:10,749
I made their first one strong
to get them happy,
1480
01:18:10,749 --> 01:18:12,251
then I go light and conserve, eh?
1481
01:18:12,293 --> 01:18:13,586
Rosie, do you feel okay?
1482
01:18:13,627 --> 01:18:14,920
You look a little tired.
1483
01:18:17,006 --> 01:18:18,883
Thanks for the understatement.
1484
01:18:21,427 --> 01:18:22,595
How do you like C.C. Hill?
1485
01:18:22,595 --> 01:18:24,096
Isn't he a dream boy?
1486
01:18:24,096 --> 01:18:25,514
Mm-hmm, but I-I--
1487
01:18:25,598 --> 01:18:27,016
I'm not going to him.
1488
01:18:28,058 --> 01:18:29,435
You're not?
1489
01:18:29,476 --> 01:18:32,146
I've got another doctor named
Sapirstein, an older man.
1490
01:18:32,897 --> 01:18:34,607
Oh, congratulations, Papa.
1491
01:18:34,648 --> 01:18:36,025
Thanks. Weren't nothing to it.
1492
01:18:36,066 --> 01:18:37,651
Ro, I'm going to take that dip inside.
1493
01:18:37,693 --> 01:18:40,196
Oh, yeah, please.
See my flowers?
1494
01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:41,697
Yeah.
1495
01:18:41,739 --> 01:18:43,449
Elise, will you give me a hand?
1496
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,909
Oh, yeah, sure.
1497
01:18:50,581 --> 01:18:53,209
Hey, whatever happened to the other guy?
Is he still blind?
1498
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,836
Donald Baumgart?
Well, you know who he is.
1499
01:18:55,878 --> 01:18:57,338
He's the boy that Zoe Piper
lives with.
1500
01:18:57,379 --> 01:18:59,131
He's writing a play.
1501
01:18:59,131 --> 01:19:00,424
Is he still blind?
1502
01:19:00,466 --> 01:19:02,760
Yeah. He's going through hell
1503
01:19:02,801 --> 01:19:03,969
trying to make the adjustment.
1504
01:19:04,678 --> 01:19:06,305
He dictates, and Zoe writes.
1505
01:19:14,438 --> 01:19:15,689
Are you all right?
1506
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:19,485
Yeah, I'm fine.
1507
01:19:19,526 --> 01:19:20,945
I just had a cramp for a minute.
1508
01:19:22,154 --> 01:19:23,739
Don't cry.
It's all right.
1509
01:19:23,739 --> 01:19:24,490
It's good for her.
1510
01:19:24,531 --> 01:19:25,991
Let her cry it out.
1511
01:19:26,033 --> 01:19:27,117
It's all right, darling.
It's all right.
1512
01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:28,827
Sit down, sit down.
1513
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:35,417
Hey, let me in.
1514
01:19:35,459 --> 01:19:36,627
Sorry, girls only.
1515
01:19:36,669 --> 01:19:37,670
I want to talk to Rosemary.
1516
01:19:37,711 --> 01:19:39,004
You can't.
She's busy.
1517
01:19:39,004 --> 01:19:40,965
I have to wash these--
Use the bathroom.
1518
01:19:46,178 --> 01:19:47,805
It hurts so much.
1519
01:19:47,846 --> 01:19:49,682
I'm so afraid the baby's gonna die.
1520
01:19:50,266 --> 01:19:51,350
When did the pain start?
1521
01:19:52,559 --> 01:19:54,019
um...
1522
01:19:54,061 --> 01:19:55,854
in, uh, November.
1523
01:19:56,355 --> 01:19:58,023
November?
What?
1524
01:19:59,024 --> 01:20:01,151
You have been in pain
since November,
1525
01:20:01,193 --> 01:20:02,903
and he's not doing anything
to help you?
1526
01:20:02,945 --> 01:20:04,863
He says it's gonna stop.
1527
01:20:05,823 --> 01:20:07,366
Why don't you go to see another doctor?
1528
01:20:07,366 --> 01:20:08,993
No, he's very good.
1529
01:20:09,576 --> 01:20:11,704
He was on Open End.
1530
01:20:11,745 --> 01:20:13,914
He sounds like a sadistic nut.
1531
01:20:13,956 --> 01:20:16,250
Rosemary, pain like that
1532
01:20:16,292 --> 01:20:18,669
is a warning that something isn't right.
1533
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:21,547
Go see Dr. Hill.
1534
01:20:21,588 --> 01:20:23,632
Go see anybody besides that-- that--
1535
01:20:23,674 --> 01:20:25,509
That nut.
1536
01:20:25,551 --> 01:20:27,386
You can't go on suffering like this.
1537
01:20:27,386 --> 01:20:29,138
I won't have an abortion.
1538
01:20:29,179 --> 01:20:31,598
Nobody's telling you
to have an abortion.
1539
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:33,267
Just go to see another
doctor, that's all.
1540
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:44,445
The thing to do now is move.
1541
01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:46,613
Guy?
1542
01:20:46,655 --> 01:20:47,990
Yeah?
1543
01:20:48,032 --> 01:20:50,159
I'm going to Dr. Hill Monday morning.
1544
01:20:52,202 --> 01:20:55,539
Dr. Sapirstein is either
lying, or he's--
1545
01:20:55,581 --> 01:20:57,791
I don't know, out of his mind.
1546
01:20:57,833 --> 01:21:00,085
Pain like this is a warning
something's wrong.
1547
01:21:00,085 --> 01:21:01,337
Rosemary--
1548
01:21:01,378 --> 01:21:04,214
And I'm not drinking Minnie's
drink anymore.
1549
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,759
I want vitamins and pills
like everyone else.
1550
01:21:08,427 --> 01:21:10,429
I haven't drunk it for
the last three days.
1551
01:21:10,429 --> 01:21:11,430
I've thrown it away.
1552
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:12,681
You've what?
1553
01:21:12,723 --> 01:21:14,433
I've made my own drink.
1554
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:18,312
Is that what those bitches
were giving you in there?
1555
01:21:19,646 --> 01:21:21,607
And is that their hint for today?
1556
01:21:21,648 --> 01:21:22,941
They're my friends--
1557
01:21:22,983 --> 01:21:25,611
They're a bunch of not
very bright bitches
1558
01:21:25,611 --> 01:21:27,738
who ought to mind their
own goddamn business!
1559
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:30,074
All they said was get a second opinion.
1560
01:21:30,115 --> 01:21:31,784
Rosemary, you got the best
doctor in New York.
1561
01:21:31,825 --> 01:21:32,951
You know who Dr. Hill is?
1562
01:21:32,951 --> 01:21:34,495
He's a charlie nobody.
1563
01:21:34,536 --> 01:21:35,871
That's who he is!
1564
01:21:35,913 --> 01:21:39,249
I'm tired of hearing how
great Dr. Sapirstein is.
1565
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:42,044
Well, we'll have to pay Sapirstein.
1566
01:21:42,086 --> 01:21:44,463
We'll have to pay Hill.
It's out of the question.
1567
01:21:44,463 --> 01:21:46,382
No, I'm not changing.
1568
01:21:46,423 --> 01:21:48,967
I just wanna go to Dr. Hill
and get a second opinion.
1569
01:21:49,009 --> 01:21:50,761
I won't let you do it, Ro.
1570
01:21:50,803 --> 01:21:52,971
I mean, because it's, uh--
1571
01:21:52,971 --> 01:21:54,473
It's not fair to Sapirstein.
1572
01:21:55,349 --> 01:21:57,351
Not fair to--
1573
01:21:58,143 --> 01:22:00,145
What are you talking about?
1574
01:22:00,145 --> 01:22:01,939
What about what's fair to me?
1575
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:04,233
You want a second opinion?
1576
01:22:04,274 --> 01:22:07,820
You tell Sapirstein and let
him decide who gives it.
1577
01:22:07,861 --> 01:22:10,531
No! I want Dr. Hill!
1578
01:22:10,572 --> 01:22:12,074
At least have that much courtesy--
If you won't pay,
1579
01:22:12,116 --> 01:22:13,283
then I'll--
1580
01:22:17,663 --> 01:22:18,997
Ro?
1581
01:22:19,998 --> 01:22:22,126
Rosemary?
What is it?
1582
01:22:23,794 --> 01:22:25,003
It stopped.
1583
01:22:26,463 --> 01:22:28,507
What?
1584
01:22:28,549 --> 01:22:30,676
The pain stopped just like that.
1585
01:22:30,676 --> 01:22:32,386
Stopped?
Stopped.
1586
01:22:34,847 --> 01:22:36,390
What was in that drink you made?
1587
01:22:39,143 --> 01:22:40,269
uh...
1588
01:22:40,894 --> 01:22:43,147
eggs, milk, sug--
1589
01:22:43,605 --> 01:22:45,232
Sugar.
1590
01:22:45,274 --> 01:22:46,525
What else?
1591
01:22:49,236 --> 01:22:50,863
Ha!
What else?
1592
01:22:52,364 --> 01:22:54,867
Come on, Rosemary, for Christ's sakes,
what else was in that drink?
1593
01:22:57,161 --> 01:22:58,704
It's alive!
1594
01:22:58,745 --> 01:23:00,914
Guy, it's moving!
1595
01:23:00,956 --> 01:23:02,541
It's alive!
It's all right!
1596
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:05,461
Feel. Feel.
1597
01:23:05,502 --> 01:23:07,045
Oh, yeah, I felt it.
1598
01:23:07,045 --> 01:23:08,922
Don't be scared.
It won't bite you.
1599
01:23:08,964 --> 01:23:10,466
It's wonderful.
It really is.
1600
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:13,051
I feel it kicking.
1601
01:23:13,677 --> 01:23:16,346
It's alive!
It's moving!
1602
01:23:21,226 --> 01:23:23,520
I'll, uh, clean up some of this mess.
1603
01:23:40,913 --> 01:23:42,414
Watch the walls.
1604
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,634
Thanks, boys.
Have one on the baby.
1605
01:23:53,675 --> 01:23:54,927
Thank you very much.
1606
01:24:24,414 --> 01:24:25,874
What's that for?
1607
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:27,918
This is my hospital suitcase.
1608
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:30,337
Honey, you got three weeks.
1609
01:24:36,635 --> 01:24:38,053
Yes?
1610
01:24:38,095 --> 01:24:39,638
Hello, Mrs. Cardiff.
1611
01:24:41,765 --> 01:24:42,975
No.
1612
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,394
Oh, my God.
1613
01:24:47,813 --> 01:24:49,147
Oh, my God.
1614
01:24:50,065 --> 01:24:51,608
Yes, of course I will.
1615
01:25:03,954 --> 01:25:05,330
Hutch is dead.
1616
01:25:11,003 --> 01:25:12,504
I feel awful.
1617
01:25:12,546 --> 01:25:14,172
All this time, I didn't
even think of him.
1618
01:25:37,154 --> 01:25:38,905
Doris, we'll see you later.
1619
01:25:38,947 --> 01:25:40,741
I beg your pardon.
1620
01:25:40,782 --> 01:25:43,035
I'm Mrs. Woodhouse.
I knew your father.
1621
01:25:43,035 --> 01:25:44,536
Oh, so you're Rosemary.
1622
01:25:44,578 --> 01:25:45,871
I'm terribly sorry.
1623
01:25:45,871 --> 01:25:47,748
Thank you.
This is my sister Edna.
1624
01:25:47,789 --> 01:25:49,750
How do you do?
And my husband.
1625
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:51,877
How do you do?
I'm sorry to be late.
1626
01:25:51,877 --> 01:25:54,004
Excuse me.
Yes?
1627
01:25:54,046 --> 01:25:56,715
I'm Grace Cardiff.
I was hoping to meet you.
1628
01:25:56,757 --> 01:25:58,050
Thank you for calling me.
1629
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:00,510
I was going to mail this, but then
I thought you would be here.
1630
01:26:00,552 --> 01:26:03,096
What is it?
A book.
1631
01:26:03,138 --> 01:26:05,098
Hutch regained consciousness
at the end,
1632
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,392
and he thought it was the next morning.
1633
01:26:07,392 --> 01:26:08,727
You know, when you had the appointment.
1634
01:26:08,727 --> 01:26:10,896
Oh, yes.
1635
01:26:10,937 --> 01:26:12,397
I wasn't there, but he told the doctor
1636
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:14,900
to make sure you got the
book that was on his desk.
1637
01:26:14,941 --> 01:26:16,234
Thank you.
1638
01:26:17,903 --> 01:26:20,030
Oh, and I'm to tell you
the name is an anagram.
1639
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:21,073
The name of the book?
1640
01:26:21,615 --> 01:26:23,367
Apparently.
1641
01:26:23,408 --> 01:26:25,369
He was delirious, so
it's hard to be sure.
1642
01:26:51,603 --> 01:26:52,896
I heard you come in.
1643
01:26:52,938 --> 01:26:54,272
It certainly wasn't very long.
1644
01:26:54,272 --> 01:26:55,941
I was late.
I couldn't get a taxi.
1645
01:26:55,941 --> 01:26:57,651
Oh, what a shame.
1646
01:26:57,693 --> 01:26:58,777
Oh, you got mail already?
1647
01:26:59,778 --> 01:27:01,613
Somebody gave it to me.
1648
01:27:01,655 --> 01:27:03,281
Here. I'll hold it.
1649
01:27:03,865 --> 01:27:05,158
Book.
1650
01:27:06,952 --> 01:27:08,328
Oh, I know that house.
1651
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:09,621
The Gilmores used to live there.
1652
01:27:09,621 --> 01:27:11,289
Oh?
Yeah.
1653
01:27:11,331 --> 01:27:13,417
I've been there lots of times.
1654
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:15,711
Grace-- That's one of my favorite names.
1655
01:27:15,752 --> 01:27:16,962
Yes.
1656
01:27:16,962 --> 01:27:18,463
You need anything?
1657
01:27:18,505 --> 01:27:20,924
Nothing, thank you.
Take a nap, why don't you?
1658
01:27:20,966 --> 01:27:22,300
I'm going to.
Yeah. Good-bye.
1659
01:28:04,259 --> 01:28:07,012
"Born in Glasgow in 1846,

1660
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:49,306
he was soon after brought to New York."
1661
01:28:09,347 --> 01:28:11,349
"He resided for several
years in the United St--

1662
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:55,353
He was attacked by a mob"
outside the Bram--
1663
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:19,191
Outside, not in the lobby."
1664
01:28:29,367 --> 01:28:31,703
There are no witches.
Not really.
1665
01:28:35,373 --> 01:28:36,792
The name is an anagram.
1666
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:01,459
Now, that really makes sense.
1667
01:30:04,254 --> 01:30:05,881
Poor Hutch.
1668
01:31:01,937 --> 01:31:03,355
Ro?
1669
01:31:07,984 --> 01:31:09,027
What's with the chain?
1670
01:31:12,822 --> 01:31:13,823
What's the matter?
1671
01:31:16,034 --> 01:31:17,369
You all right?
I'm fine.
1672
01:31:18,078 --> 01:31:19,454
Oh.
1673
01:31:19,496 --> 01:31:20,789
Oh, why, thank you.
1674
01:31:21,373 --> 01:31:22,666
How was the funeral?
1675
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:24,542
Okay.
1676
01:31:24,584 --> 01:31:26,544
Got the shirt that was
in the New Yorker.
1677
01:31:31,925 --> 01:31:34,219
I got that shirt that
was in the New Yorker.
1678
01:31:34,219 --> 01:31:36,221
That's nice.
1679
01:31:36,221 --> 01:31:37,555
Do you know who Roman really is?
1680
01:31:37,555 --> 01:31:39,224
What do you mean, honey?
1681
01:31:39,224 --> 01:31:41,726
He's Adrian Marcato's son.
What?
1682
01:31:41,726 --> 01:31:43,395
Come here.
1683
01:31:43,436 --> 01:31:44,980
I want to show you something.
1684
01:31:46,356 --> 01:31:49,859
Roman Castevet is Steven
Marcato rearranged.
1685
01:31:51,945 --> 01:31:53,697
It's from Hutch.
1686
01:31:59,285 --> 01:32:00,578
Look.
1687
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:03,665
And look here.
1688
01:32:03,707 --> 01:32:06,459
There he is when he was 13.
See the eyes?
1689
01:32:09,379 --> 01:32:10,797
Coincidence.
1690
01:32:10,839 --> 01:32:13,758
In the same house?
And look. Look here.
1691
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,428
"Soon after that in August, 1886,

1692
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:58,221
his son Steven was born."
1693
01:32:18,263 --> 01:32:19,556
1886. Got it?
1694
01:32:19,597 --> 01:32:21,099
That makes him 79 now.
1695
01:32:21,891 --> 01:32:23,476
No coincidence.
1696
01:32:28,148 --> 01:32:30,442
No, I guess not.
1697
01:32:30,483 --> 01:32:32,027
He's Steven Marcato, all right.
1698
01:32:33,528 --> 01:32:35,947
Poor old geezer.
With a crazy father like that,
1699
01:32:35,989 --> 01:32:38,116
no wonder he switched his name around.
1700
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:40,452
You don't think he's the same?
1701
01:32:40,493 --> 01:32:42,454
What do you mean, a witch?
1702
01:32:42,495 --> 01:32:45,790
Ro, are you kidding?
Oh, Ro, honey.
1703
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:49,085
His father was a martyr to it.
1704
01:32:49,127 --> 01:32:50,295
Do you know how he died?
1705
01:32:50,336 --> 01:32:52,756
Honey, it's 1966.
1706
01:32:52,797 --> 01:32:55,258
This was published in 1933.
1707
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:56,718
There were covens in Europe.
1708
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,804
That's what they're called--
the, um, congregation.
1709
01:32:59,846 --> 01:33:02,474
Covens in Europe, in America,
and in Australia,
1710
01:33:02,474 --> 01:33:04,976
and they have one right
here, that whole bunch.
1711
01:33:04,976 --> 01:33:07,729
The parties with the singing and
the flute and the chanting,
1712
01:33:07,771 --> 01:33:09,773
those are esbats or Sabbaths
or whatever they're called.
1713
01:33:09,814 --> 01:33:12,317
Honey, don't get excited.
Read what they do, Guy.
1714
01:33:12,317 --> 01:33:14,194
They use blood in their rituals.
1715
01:33:14,235 --> 01:33:17,030
The blood that has the most
power is baby's blood.
1716
01:33:17,072 --> 01:33:19,240
And they don't just use the blood,
they use the flesh, too.
1717
01:33:19,282 --> 01:33:21,201
Rosemary, for God's sakes!
1718
01:33:21,242 --> 01:33:23,661
They're not setting foot in
this apartment ever again.
1719
01:33:23,703 --> 01:33:25,663
They're not coming within
50 feet of the baby.
1720
01:33:25,705 --> 01:33:28,541
They're old people.
They have a bunch of old friends.
1721
01:33:28,583 --> 01:33:31,127
Dr. Shand happens to play the recorder.
1722
01:33:31,169 --> 01:33:33,630
I'm not taking any chances
with the baby's safety.
1723
01:33:33,671 --> 01:33:35,006
We're gonna sublet and move out.
1724
01:33:35,006 --> 01:33:36,299
We are not.
1725
01:33:36,341 --> 01:33:37,801
We'll talk about it later.
1726
01:33:42,263 --> 01:33:44,182
I don't think you ought
to read any more of that.
1727
01:33:45,183 --> 01:33:46,184
Just this last chapter.
1728
01:33:46,226 --> 01:33:47,685
Not today, honey.
1729
01:33:48,645 --> 01:33:49,771
Look. Your hands are shaking.
1730
01:33:49,813 --> 01:33:51,022
Come on.
Give it to me.
1731
01:33:51,022 --> 01:33:53,650
Guy!
I mean it, now.
1732
01:33:53,650 --> 01:33:54,943
Give it to me.
1733
01:34:03,743 --> 01:34:06,538
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.
1734
01:34:06,538 --> 01:34:07,997
What'd you say the name was,
Marchado?
1735
01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:09,541
Marcato.
1736
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:11,793
He told me his father
was a coffee importer.
1737
01:34:11,835 --> 01:34:13,545
He told Guy he was a producer.
1738
01:34:13,586 --> 01:34:14,921
I understand how disturbed
you must be
1739
01:34:14,963 --> 01:34:16,756
to have him for a close neighbor.
1740
01:34:16,798 --> 01:34:19,384
I don't want anything more
to do with him or Minnie.
1741
01:34:19,384 --> 01:34:21,386
I can't take even the slightest chance
1742
01:34:21,386 --> 01:34:22,554
where the baby's safety's concerned.
1743
01:34:22,554 --> 01:34:24,097
Absolutely.
Any mother'd feel the same way.
1744
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:27,350
Is there any chance at all
1745
01:34:27,392 --> 01:34:29,602
that maybe Minnie put something
harmful in those drinks
1746
01:34:29,644 --> 01:34:31,062
or in those little cakes?
1747
01:34:31,104 --> 01:34:34,816
No, Rosemary, I'd have seen
evidence of it long ago.
1748
01:34:34,858 --> 01:34:36,359
I won't take anything else
from them.
1749
01:34:36,401 --> 01:34:37,861
You won't have to.
1750
01:34:37,902 --> 01:34:39,404
I can give you some pills
1751
01:34:39,404 --> 01:34:41,573
that'll be adequate
these last few weeks.
1752
01:34:42,490 --> 01:34:45,326
In a way, this may be the answer
1753
01:34:45,368 --> 01:34:47,412
to Minnie and Roman's problem, too.
1754
01:34:47,412 --> 01:34:48,663
What do you mean?
1755
01:34:48,705 --> 01:34:50,373
Roman's very ill.
1756
01:34:50,415 --> 01:34:54,002
In fact, confidentially, he has
no more than a month or two left.
1757
01:34:54,043 --> 01:34:55,378
I had no idea.
1758
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:58,423
He wanted to pay a last visit to
a few of his favorite cities.
1759
01:34:58,423 --> 01:34:59,632
They didn't want to offend you
1760
01:34:59,674 --> 01:35:00,884
by leaving before the baby's birth.
1761
01:35:01,759 --> 01:35:03,928
I'm sorry to hear that Roman isn't well.
1762
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:05,513
He'd be extremely embarrassed
1763
01:35:05,555 --> 01:35:07,724
if he knew what you found out.
1764
01:35:07,765 --> 01:35:10,518
Suppose we do this.
I'll tell him to leave on Sunday.
1765
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,729
I'll say I spoke to you,
and you understand.
1766
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:14,939
Are you sure they'll leave on Sunday?
1767
01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:15,899
I'll see to it.
1768
01:35:18,902 --> 01:35:20,695
No matter where we are,
1769
01:35:20,737 --> 01:35:21,905
our thoughts are gonna
be with you every minute
1770
01:35:22,947 --> 01:35:24,782
till you're all happy and thin again,
1771
01:35:24,782 --> 01:35:25,950
your sweet little boy or girl
1772
01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:27,994
laying safely in your arms.
1773
01:35:28,036 --> 01:35:29,871
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.
1774
01:35:29,913 --> 01:35:32,123
Yeah. You make Guy send us
lots of pictures, ya hear?
1775
01:35:32,165 --> 01:35:33,666
Yes, I will.
1776
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:35,418
Now, I'm not going to
wish you good luck,
1777
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:36,628
because you won't need it.
1778
01:35:36,628 --> 01:35:38,880
You're going to have
a happy, happy life.
1779
01:35:38,922 --> 01:35:41,758
Have a good trip and come back safely.
1780
01:35:41,799 --> 01:35:45,470
Perhaps. But I may stay
in Dubrovnik or Pescara
1781
01:35:45,511 --> 01:35:47,305
or maybe Majorca.
1782
01:35:47,347 --> 01:35:49,140
We shall see.
We shall see.
1783
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:50,683
Come back.
Bye, Minnie.
1784
01:35:50,725 --> 01:35:52,143
Yeah, good-bye.
1785
01:35:52,143 --> 01:35:53,811
Good-bye, Roman.
Bye-bye.
1786
01:35:53,811 --> 01:35:54,646
Take care now.
1787
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,023
Kennedy airport, Pan Am building.
1788
01:35:57,774 --> 01:35:59,651
Bye!
Bye, Roman.
1789
01:36:02,445 --> 01:36:03,821
Oh, boy.
1790
01:36:09,577 --> 01:36:11,329
Guy?
Hmm?
1791
01:36:11,371 --> 01:36:13,331
Where's my book?
1792
01:36:13,373 --> 01:36:15,667
Oh, I put it in the garbage.
1793
01:36:18,169 --> 01:36:19,420
What?
1794
01:36:19,462 --> 01:36:21,798
I didn't want you upsetting
yourself anymore.
1795
01:36:21,839 --> 01:36:24,384
Guy, Hutch gave me that book.
1796
01:36:24,425 --> 01:36:25,635
He left it to me.
1797
01:36:25,677 --> 01:36:27,053
I wasn't thinking about that.
1798
01:36:27,095 --> 01:36:28,680
That's a terrible thing to do.
1799
01:36:28,721 --> 01:36:30,223
I'm sorry. I wasn't
thinking about Hutch.
1800
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:39,857
Hey, watch out, lady!
1801
01:37:34,579 --> 01:37:38,541
"In some cults it was believed that
a personal possession of the victim

1802
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:21,794
was necessary and spells cannot be cast"
1803
01:37:41,836 --> 01:37:44,047
without one of the victim's belongings."
1804
01:37:44,839 --> 01:37:47,759
Yeah?
Is this Donald Baumgart?
1805
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:50,928
That's right.
This is Rosemary Woodhouse,
1806
01:37:50,928 --> 01:37:52,513
Guy Woodhouse's wife.
1807
01:37:52,555 --> 01:37:53,848
Oh, yes.
1808
01:37:53,890 --> 01:37:55,683
I want to know--
1809
01:37:55,725 --> 01:37:58,019
You must be a happy little lady,
1810
01:37:58,061 --> 01:38:00,563
living in the Bram, rows
of uniformed lackeys.
1811
01:38:00,605 --> 01:38:01,773
I wanted to know how you are,
1812
01:38:01,773 --> 01:38:02,940
if there's been any improvement.
1813
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,609
Well, bless your heart.
1814
01:38:04,609 --> 01:38:08,071
Ha, ha, hal
Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?
1815
01:38:08,112 --> 01:38:11,199
Well, I'm splendid.
I only broke six glasses today.
1816
01:38:13,785 --> 01:38:15,953
Guy and I are both very unhappy
1817
01:38:15,995 --> 01:38:19,123
that he got his break because
of your misfortune.
1818
01:38:22,251 --> 01:38:24,670
Aw, what the hell.
1819
01:38:24,712 --> 01:38:26,089
That's the way it goes, right?
1820
01:38:27,632 --> 01:38:30,468
I'm sorry I didn't come along
that day he came to visit you.
1821
01:38:31,594 --> 01:38:33,805
V-Visit?
1822
01:38:33,805 --> 01:38:36,808
Oh, you mean the day we met for drinks?
1823
01:38:37,725 --> 01:38:39,227
Yes, that's what I meant.
1824
01:38:40,895 --> 01:38:43,648
By the way, he has something
of yours, you know.
1825
01:38:43,689 --> 01:38:44,899
What do you mean?
1826
01:38:44,941 --> 01:38:47,151
Don't you know?
1827
01:38:47,151 --> 01:38:48,486
No.
1828
01:38:48,528 --> 01:38:50,238
Didn't you miss anything that day?
1829
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:54,117
You don't mean my tie, do you?
1830
01:38:55,034 --> 01:38:56,494
Yes.
1831
01:38:56,536 --> 01:38:59,831
Oh, well, he's got mine,
and I've got his.
1832
01:38:59,831 --> 01:39:01,457
He can have it back.
1833
01:39:01,499 --> 01:39:03,042
I'm sorry.
1834
01:39:03,084 --> 01:39:06,671
Doesn't matter to me now what
color tie I'm wearing.
1835
01:39:06,671 --> 01:39:08,965
I didn't understand.
I thought he'd only borrowed it.
1836
01:39:09,006 --> 01:39:11,509
Oh, no.
It was a trade.
1837
01:39:12,343 --> 01:39:14,345
Or...
1838
01:39:14,387 --> 01:39:15,721
do you think he stole it?
1839
01:39:15,763 --> 01:39:17,682
I have to hang up now.
1840
01:39:17,723 --> 01:39:20,601
I just wanted to know if there'd
been any improvement.
1841
01:39:20,643 --> 01:39:22,728
No, no, there isn't.
1842
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:24,397
It was nice of you to call. Bye.
1843
01:40:02,643 --> 01:40:04,187
You aren't in labor, are you?
1844
01:40:04,228 --> 01:40:06,939
No, but I have to see the doctor.
It's very important.
1845
01:40:06,981 --> 01:40:08,608
But he has to leave at 5:00,
1846
01:40:08,649 --> 01:40:10,026
and there is Mrs. Byron.
1847
01:40:10,985 --> 01:40:12,403
I'm sure he'll see you.
Just sit down.
1848
01:40:12,445 --> 01:40:13,905
Thank you.
1849
01:40:35,593 --> 01:40:37,303
How is it out there?
1850
01:40:37,887 --> 01:40:39,597
Oh, awful. 94.
1851
01:40:40,139 --> 01:40:41,390
Ugh!
1852
01:40:41,432 --> 01:40:42,725
See you next week.
Make an appointment.
1853
01:40:42,767 --> 01:40:43,643
Yes, I will.
1854
01:40:50,358 --> 01:40:51,817
You're due any day now, aren't you?
1855
01:40:51,859 --> 01:40:53,361
Tuesday.
1856
01:40:53,402 --> 01:40:55,196
You're smart to get it
over with before August.
1857
01:40:57,532 --> 01:40:58,491
Mrs. Byron.
1858
01:40:59,534 --> 01:41:00,618
He'll see you right after.
1859
01:41:01,827 --> 01:41:03,120
Well, let's see, um...
1860
01:41:03,829 --> 01:41:05,206
July the 10th?
1861
01:41:05,248 --> 01:41:06,624
What time?
1862
01:41:06,666 --> 01:41:08,167
4:00?
Fine.
1863
01:41:08,209 --> 01:41:09,502
All right.
See you then.
1864
01:41:09,544 --> 01:41:10,711
Thank you.
1865
01:41:10,753 --> 01:41:12,088
Bye-bye.
1866
01:41:12,129 --> 01:41:14,131
Good luck.
Thank you.
1867
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:23,975
Mmm! That smells nice.
What is it?
1868
01:41:25,893 --> 01:41:28,145
Oh, my--
It's called Detchema.
1869
01:41:29,605 --> 01:41:31,190
Well, it's a big improvement
on your regular,
1870
01:41:31,232 --> 01:41:32,483
if you don't mind my saying.
1871
01:41:33,484 --> 01:41:34,569
That wasn't a perfume.
1872
01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:36,404
That was a good luck charm.
I threw it away.
1873
01:41:36,862 --> 01:41:38,531
Good.
1874
01:41:38,573 --> 01:41:40,157
Maybe the doctor will
follow your example.
1875
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:47,582
Dr. Sapirstein?
1876
01:41:47,623 --> 01:41:50,418
Yes. The aftershave.
But it isn't, is it?
1877
01:41:50,459 --> 01:41:53,254
I don't think he has a good luck charm.
1878
01:41:53,296 --> 01:41:55,131
Anyway, he has the same
smell once in a while.
1879
01:41:56,674 --> 01:41:58,342
When he does--
Oh, boy.
1880
01:41:59,343 --> 01:42:00,553
Haven't you ever noticed?
1881
01:42:00,845 --> 01:42:03,222
No.
1882
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:05,725
Well, maybe you thought it was
your own you were smelling.
1883
01:42:05,766 --> 01:42:07,560
What is it, a chemical thing?
1884
01:42:09,312 --> 01:42:11,939
Will you excuse me a moment, please?
1885
01:42:11,981 --> 01:42:13,733
My husband is waiting outside.
1886
01:42:13,774 --> 01:42:15,276
I have to go and tell him something.
1887
01:42:15,318 --> 01:42:16,694
I'll be back in a minute.
1888
01:43:05,284 --> 01:43:06,494
Dr. Hill's office.
1889
01:43:06,535 --> 01:43:07,912
Dr. Hill, please.
1890
01:43:07,953 --> 01:43:09,455
This is his answering service.
1891
01:43:09,497 --> 01:43:11,582
Would you like to leave a message?
1892
01:43:11,582 --> 01:43:15,961
Um, yes. My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.
1893
01:43:16,003 --> 01:43:17,546
Woodhouse.
1894
01:43:17,588 --> 01:43:21,092
And would you ask him to call
me back right away, please?
1895
01:43:21,133 --> 01:43:26,263
Uh, my number is 475-2598.
1896
01:43:27,348 --> 01:43:29,350
It's an emergency.
I'm in a phone booth.
1897
01:43:29,392 --> 01:43:30,518
All right.
1898
01:43:40,945 --> 01:43:43,155
Quickly, please, Dr. Hill, call me.
1899
01:43:49,954 --> 01:43:51,956
Oh, oh, really?
1900
01:43:51,997 --> 01:43:53,666
Did he really say that?
1901
01:43:53,708 --> 01:43:56,377
Oh, he didn't say that.
1902
01:43:56,419 --> 01:43:59,088
What else was it that he said?
1903
01:43:59,130 --> 01:44:01,048
Oh, that's wonderful.
1904
01:44:01,090 --> 01:44:02,758
That's wonder--
That's marvelous.
1905
01:44:04,135 --> 01:44:05,344
Yes. Dr. Hill?
1906
01:44:05,386 --> 01:44:06,762
Did I get the name right?
1907
01:44:06,804 --> 01:44:08,097
Is it Rosemary Woodhouse?
1908
01:44:08,139 --> 01:44:10,433
Yes.
Are you Dr. Hill's patient?
1909
01:44:10,766 --> 01:44:12,601
No.
1910
01:44:12,643 --> 01:44:15,563
Um, yes, I mean, well,
I've seen him once.
1911
01:44:15,604 --> 01:44:18,524
Um, please, please tell him
he has to speak to me.
1912
01:44:18,566 --> 01:44:19,984
It's important.
1913
01:44:20,025 --> 01:44:21,777
Tell him to call me, hmm?
1914
01:44:21,819 --> 01:44:23,487
All right.
Thank you.
1915
01:44:30,703 --> 01:44:34,081
All of them.
All of them.
1916
01:44:34,123 --> 01:44:37,001
All in it together.
All of them.
1917
01:44:37,001 --> 01:44:38,586
All of them witches.
1918
01:44:40,171 --> 01:44:41,756
Don't you worry, little Andy or Jenny,
1919
01:44:41,797 --> 01:44:43,841
I'll kill them before
I let them touch you.
1920
01:44:49,096 --> 01:44:50,681
Yes. Dr--
1921
01:44:50,681 --> 01:44:52,308
Mrs. Woodhouse?
Yes!
1922
01:44:52,349 --> 01:44:55,102
Oh, thank you, thank you for calling me.
1923
01:44:55,144 --> 01:44:56,562
Thought you were in California.
1924
01:44:56,604 --> 01:45:00,816
No. No, I've been to another doctor,
1925
01:45:00,858 --> 01:45:02,943
and he isn't good, Dr. Hill.
1926
01:45:02,985 --> 01:45:04,570
He's been lying to me
1927
01:45:04,612 --> 01:45:07,907
and giving me unusual kinds
of drinks and capsules.
1928
01:45:08,949 --> 01:45:10,451
The baby's due on Tuesday.
1929
01:45:10,493 --> 01:45:12,369
Remember you told me June 28th?
1930
01:45:12,411 --> 01:45:13,746
Well, I want you to deliver it.
1931
01:45:13,788 --> 01:45:15,039
Mrs. Woodhouse--
1932
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:18,125
Please let me talk to you.
1933
01:45:18,167 --> 01:45:20,711
Let me come and explain
what's been going on.
1934
01:45:20,753 --> 01:45:22,505
I can't stay too long here.
1935
01:45:22,546 --> 01:45:24,840
They'll be coming, looking for me.
1936
01:45:24,882 --> 01:45:26,300
Dr. Hill?
1937
01:45:26,342 --> 01:45:27,718
Dr. Hill, there's a plot--
1938
01:45:28,469 --> 01:45:30,137
I know that sounds crazy.
1939
01:45:30,179 --> 01:45:31,430
You're probably thinking,
1940
01:45:31,472 --> 01:45:33,557
"My God, this poor girl
has really flipped,"
1941
01:45:33,557 --> 01:45:36,560
but I haven't flipped,
Dr. Hill, I swear.
1942
01:45:36,602 --> 01:45:38,562
By all the saints, I haven't.
1943
01:45:38,562 --> 01:45:41,148
There are plots against
people, aren't there?
1944
01:45:41,190 --> 01:45:43,150
Yes, I suppose there are.
1945
01:45:43,192 --> 01:45:45,736
Well, then there's one
against me and my baby.
1946
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:49,907
Come to my office tomorrow after 5:00.
1947
01:45:49,907 --> 01:45:51,617
Now! Right now.
1948
01:45:52,743 --> 01:45:55,120
Mrs. Woodhouse, I'm
not at my office now.
1949
01:45:55,162 --> 01:45:56,664
I'm home. I've been up
since yesterday morning.
1950
01:45:56,705 --> 01:45:57,832
I beg you.
1951
01:45:58,582 --> 01:45:59,625
I beg you.
1952
01:46:01,085 --> 01:46:02,294
I can't stay here.
1953
01:46:04,213 --> 01:46:05,297
My office at 8:00.
1954
01:46:05,339 --> 01:46:07,091
Yes, thank you.
1955
01:46:07,091 --> 01:46:08,551
Oh, wait! Dr. Hill?
1956
01:46:08,592 --> 01:46:09,969
Yes?
1957
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:11,929
My husband may call you, asking--
1958
01:46:11,971 --> 01:46:13,681
I'm not gonna speak to anyone.
1959
01:46:13,722 --> 01:46:15,599
I'm gonna take a nap.
Thank you.
1960
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:51,719
Keep the change.
1961
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,637
Uh, driver, please,
1962
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:56,223
could you wait and watch until--
1963
01:46:56,265 --> 01:46:57,975
Until I'm inside the door?
1964
01:47:14,283 --> 01:47:15,659
He lied to you.
1965
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:17,786
He said we were going to Hollywood.
1966
01:47:17,828 --> 01:47:19,997
The worst thing of all, he's
involved with them as well.
1967
01:47:20,998 --> 01:47:22,207
He sleeps in pajamas now.
1968
01:47:22,249 --> 01:47:24,209
He never used to before.
1969
01:47:24,251 --> 01:47:25,794
He's probably hiding a mark.
1970
01:47:25,836 --> 01:47:28,005
You know they give you
marks when you join--
1971
01:47:28,047 --> 01:47:29,506
All sorts of rituals.
1972
01:47:29,548 --> 01:47:31,550
They hold Sabbaths there.
1973
01:47:31,592 --> 01:47:33,636
You could hear them singing
through the wall.
1974
01:47:33,677 --> 01:47:36,555
Guy, my husband Guy said
it was Dr. Shand,
1975
01:47:36,597 --> 01:47:38,349
one of these people playing a recorder.
1976
01:47:39,266 --> 01:47:41,393
Now, how did he know it was Dr. Shand
1977
01:47:41,435 --> 01:47:42,728
unless he was there with them?
1978
01:47:44,355 --> 01:47:46,941
Um, they're very clever people.
1979
01:47:46,982 --> 01:47:49,360
They planned everything
right from the beginning.
1980
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:52,613
They probably made some
sort of deal with Guy.
1981
01:47:52,655 --> 01:47:55,532
They gave him success, and
he promised them our baby
1982
01:47:55,574 --> 01:47:57,493
to use in their rituals.
1983
01:47:58,369 --> 01:48:00,204
I know this sounds crazy,
1984
01:48:00,204 --> 01:48:03,082
but I've-- I've got books here. Look.
1985
01:48:04,917 --> 01:48:08,379
There was another actor like
him, Donald Baumgart,
1986
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:10,547
and they put a spell on him.
1987
01:48:10,589 --> 01:48:12,549
They cast a spell on him
and made him blind
1988
01:48:12,549 --> 01:48:13,884
so that Guy could get his part.
1989
01:48:14,885 --> 01:48:15,886
Look, here.
1990
01:48:18,806 --> 01:48:20,724
I had this friend Edward Hutchins.
1991
01:48:20,766 --> 01:48:22,726
Maybe you heard of him, a writer.
1992
01:48:22,726 --> 01:48:24,478
He wrote stories for boys.
1993
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,063
Anyway, he was my good friend
1994
01:48:26,063 --> 01:48:27,314
since I first came to New York.
1995
01:48:27,398 --> 01:48:28,649
May I keep this?
1996
01:48:28,691 --> 01:48:32,361
Yes, please, and, look, anyway,
1997
01:48:32,403 --> 01:48:34,655
once Mr. Hutchins came to visit me--
1998
01:48:36,156 --> 01:48:37,449
Came to visit me.
1999
01:48:37,449 --> 01:48:39,994
It was the time I was having
this pain, Doctor.
2000
01:48:40,035 --> 01:48:41,203
I was suffering so--
2001
01:48:41,203 --> 01:48:43,539
You can't imagine how
much I was suffering,
2002
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:45,916
and they wouldn't help me. Nobody would.
2003
01:48:45,958 --> 01:48:48,836
They were giving me a drink
with tannis root in it.
2004
01:48:48,877 --> 01:48:52,047
Also witches' stuff, tannis root.
2005
01:48:52,089 --> 01:48:55,634
Hutch came, and he immediately
saw something was wrong.
2006
01:48:55,676 --> 01:48:57,511
He-- He knew about witches, you see.
2007
01:48:57,553 --> 01:49:00,514
Suddenly, Guy rushed in
with his makeup still on,
2008
01:49:00,556 --> 01:49:01,765
which he never did.
2009
01:49:01,807 --> 01:49:04,393
They probably called him to come home
2010
01:49:04,435 --> 01:49:06,061
and steal one of Hutch's belongings,
2011
01:49:06,103 --> 01:49:07,855
which he did.
Took his glove,
2012
01:49:07,896 --> 01:49:10,107
and they put a spell on him, too.
2013
01:49:10,149 --> 01:49:12,818
Put him in a coma.
Three months later, he died.
2014
01:49:14,778 --> 01:49:17,281
Now, maybe all of this is coincidence,
2015
01:49:17,281 --> 01:49:18,532
but one thing is for sure.
2016
01:49:18,574 --> 01:49:20,451
They have a coven, and
they want my baby.
2017
01:49:24,163 --> 01:49:25,581
Certainly seems that way.
2018
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:38,635
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.
2019
01:49:38,635 --> 01:49:40,345
I don't believe in witchcraft,
2020
01:49:40,387 --> 01:49:42,806
but there are plenty of maniacs
and crazy people in this city.
2021
01:49:44,266 --> 01:49:45,684
The doctor's name is Shand, you say?
2022
01:49:45,726 --> 01:49:49,146
N-No, Dr. Shand is one of these people.
2023
01:49:49,188 --> 01:49:50,689
The doctor's name is Sapirstein.
2024
01:49:52,274 --> 01:49:53,525
Abraham Sapirstein?
2025
01:49:54,151 --> 01:49:55,486
Yeah.
2026
01:49:56,987 --> 01:49:58,280
Do you know him?
2027
01:49:58,322 --> 01:49:59,823
I've met him once or twice.
2028
01:50:00,699 --> 01:50:02,576
To look at him, you'd never think he--
2029
01:50:02,618 --> 01:50:04,495
No, you wouldn't.
Not in a million years.
2030
01:50:05,871 --> 01:50:07,998
Would you like to go into
Mount Sinai right now,
2031
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:08,999
this evening?
2032
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,295
Yeah, I would love to.
Would that be possible?
2033
01:50:13,337 --> 01:50:14,838
It's difficult, but we'll try.
2034
01:50:16,423 --> 01:50:17,841
I want you to lie down
and get some rest.
2035
01:50:17,883 --> 01:50:20,177
Thanks.
2036
01:50:20,177 --> 01:50:23,514
Anything they've got, even
a broom closet'd be fine.
2037
01:50:23,514 --> 01:50:25,015
I hope we can do better than that.
2038
01:50:31,939 --> 01:50:34,024
I'll see what I can do,
then I'll check you over.
2039
01:50:37,694 --> 01:50:39,822
Oh, should I undress now?
2040
01:50:39,863 --> 01:50:41,740
No. It'll take me about a half
an hour on the telephone.
2041
01:50:41,782 --> 01:50:42,908
You just lie down, rest.
2042
01:50:45,702 --> 01:50:46,829
Okay?
2043
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:47,913
Okay.
2044
01:50:56,588 --> 01:50:58,507
God bless Dr. Hill.
2045
01:51:05,055 --> 01:51:07,641
Everything's going to be
okay, now, Andy or Jenny.
2046
01:51:08,725 --> 01:51:11,562
We're going to be in
a nice, clean hospital
2047
01:51:11,603 --> 01:51:13,188
with no visitors.
2048
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:17,693
Oh.
2049
01:51:35,085 --> 01:51:36,170
Monsters.
2050
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:40,757
Monsters.
2051
01:51:44,261 --> 01:51:45,804
Unspeakable.
2052
01:51:46,889 --> 01:51:48,098
Unspeakable.
2053
01:52:20,464 --> 01:52:21,882
I was sleeping.
2054
01:52:36,813 --> 01:52:38,941
Come with us quietly, Rosemary.
2055
01:52:38,982 --> 01:52:41,151
Don't argue or make a scene
2056
01:52:41,151 --> 01:52:43,820
because if you say anything more
about witches or witchcraft,
2057
01:52:43,862 --> 01:52:46,281
we're going to be forced to take
you to a mental hospital.
2058
01:52:46,323 --> 01:52:47,491
You don't want that, do you?
2059
01:52:47,532 --> 01:52:49,660
So put your shoes on.
2060
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:51,662
We just want to take you home.
2061
01:52:51,703 --> 01:52:52,996
No one's going to hurt you.
2062
01:52:53,038 --> 01:52:54,790
Or the baby.
Put your shoes on.
2063
01:53:14,351 --> 01:53:16,019
She's fine now.
2064
01:53:16,061 --> 01:53:18,272
We're going to go home and rest.
2065
01:53:18,313 --> 01:53:19,690
That's all it takes.
2066
01:53:19,690 --> 01:53:21,441
Thank you for your trouble, Doctor.
2067
01:53:21,483 --> 01:53:22,943
Glad I could be of help, sir.
2068
01:53:22,985 --> 01:53:24,861
It's a shame you had to
come in here.
2069
01:54:18,415 --> 01:54:19,166
Good evening, Mrs. Woodhouse.
2070
01:54:35,307 --> 01:54:36,433
Mrs. Woodhouse!
2071
01:54:37,893 --> 01:54:39,269
Mrs. Woodhouse!
2072
01:55:04,961 --> 01:55:05,962
Uhh!
2073
01:55:43,708 --> 01:55:45,001
Ro!
2074
01:55:45,043 --> 01:55:48,797
Ro! Ro!
2075
01:55:48,839 --> 01:55:50,340
Ro, baby, Ro!
2076
01:55:51,341 --> 01:55:52,467
Ro!
2077
01:55:56,012 --> 01:55:58,014
Come on, open up, Ro.
Go to hell!
2078
01:55:58,056 --> 01:55:59,099
Come on, honey.
No one's going to hurt you.
2079
01:55:59,141 --> 01:56:02,018
You promised them the baby, get out!
2080
01:56:02,018 --> 01:56:03,228
No, I didn't promise them anything.
2081
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:04,312
What are you talking about?
Promised who?
2082
01:56:04,354 --> 01:56:05,522
Rosemary, you're--
2083
01:56:38,555 --> 01:56:40,223
Hello.
Elise.
2084
01:56:40,265 --> 01:56:42,767
Mrs. Dunstan is out.
Who is this?
2085
01:56:42,809 --> 01:56:44,561
The babysitter.
Do you know where she went?
2086
01:56:44,603 --> 01:56:46,354
They went to the movies.
2087
01:56:46,396 --> 01:56:49,191
This is Rosemary.
Please ask her to call Rosemary
2088
01:56:49,232 --> 01:56:50,942
the second she gets home.
2089
01:56:50,984 --> 01:56:54,154
It's terribly urgent. Don't--
Don't forget.
2090
01:56:54,196 --> 01:56:55,489
Don't worry.
I'll tell her.
2091
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:56,448
Thank you.
2092
01:57:03,663 --> 01:57:05,040
We don't want to hurt you, Ro.
2093
01:57:06,249 --> 01:57:08,418
We're your friends, Rosemary.
2094
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:10,629
There's nothing to be
afraid of, Rosemary.
2095
01:57:10,670 --> 01:57:12,255
Honest and truly there isn't.
2096
01:57:12,255 --> 01:57:14,799
This is nothing but a mild
sedative to calm you down.
2097
01:57:14,841 --> 01:57:15,759
You know I wouldn't let any--
2098
01:57:15,759 --> 01:57:18,261
Ro.
2099
01:57:18,261 --> 01:57:19,387
Aah!
2100
01:57:19,429 --> 01:57:20,889
Ro, Ro!
2101
01:57:20,931 --> 01:57:23,350
Help me!
Oh, Ro, baby.
2102
01:57:23,391 --> 01:57:25,644
Somebody, help me!
2103
01:57:25,685 --> 01:57:28,188
Aah!
2104
01:57:37,197 --> 01:57:38,240
Wait a minute.
2105
01:57:38,782 --> 01:57:40,492
Wait a minute now.
2106
01:57:46,331 --> 01:57:47,874
We happen to be in labor here.
2107
01:57:47,916 --> 01:57:49,167
Here?
2108
01:57:49,209 --> 01:57:51,628
Here.
You're all right, baby.
2109
01:57:51,670 --> 01:57:54,256
You're gonna be perfectly all right.
I swear to God you will.
2110
01:57:54,297 --> 01:57:56,299
There were supposed to
be doctors, hospitals!
2111
01:57:56,341 --> 01:57:59,469
Doctors, hospitals!
2112
01:57:59,469 --> 01:58:01,388
Everything-- Everything's
clean and sterile!
2113
01:58:02,556 --> 01:58:04,808
No, she isn't here, Elise.
2114
01:58:04,808 --> 01:58:05,976
I'll have her call you back.
2115
01:58:11,898 --> 01:58:13,692
Oh, Andy...
2116
01:58:13,733 --> 01:58:15,318
Andy or Jenny...
2117
01:58:16,278 --> 01:58:19,281
I-I'm sorry, my little darling.
2118
01:58:20,657 --> 01:58:21,992
Forgive me!
2119
01:58:33,503 --> 01:58:34,588
Hi.
2120
01:58:40,343 --> 01:58:41,678
Hi.
2121
01:58:43,513 --> 01:58:45,557
Is it all right?
2122
01:58:47,017 --> 01:58:49,311
Yes, it's fine.
2123
01:58:52,355 --> 01:58:53,440
What is it?
2124
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:55,442
A boy.
2125
01:59:00,030 --> 01:59:02,449
Really? A boy.
2126
01:59:12,792 --> 01:59:14,085
And it's all right?
2127
01:59:14,669 --> 01:59:15,712
Yes.
2128
01:59:35,649 --> 01:59:36,816
Where is it?
2129
01:59:36,858 --> 01:59:40,570
Ohh! Oh, my goodness.
2130
01:59:40,570 --> 01:59:43,323
Oh, gee, what a start you
gave me. My goodness.
2131
01:59:43,365 --> 01:59:45,325
The baby, where is it?
2132
01:59:45,367 --> 01:59:48,411
Oh, uh, you wait here one minute.
2133
01:59:50,789 --> 01:59:51,998
Where's my baby?
2134
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:54,834
Uh, I'll go find Dr. Abe.
2135
01:59:54,876 --> 01:59:56,336
Ju-Just wait.
2136
02:00:12,811 --> 02:00:13,687
Where's the baby?
2137
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:18,608
Where is it?
2138
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:20,402
Honey--
2139
02:00:21,945 --> 02:00:23,613
There were complications,
Rosemary,
2140
02:00:23,655 --> 02:00:25,240
but nothing that will
affect future births.
2141
02:00:28,868 --> 02:00:30,120
It's--
2142
02:00:32,038 --> 02:00:33,748
Dead.
2143
02:00:33,790 --> 02:00:35,041
It was in the wrong position.
2144
02:00:35,083 --> 02:00:37,001
In the hospital I might have been
able to do something about it,
2145
02:00:37,043 --> 02:00:38,294
but you wouldn't listen.
2146
02:00:38,336 --> 02:00:39,754
Honey, we can have others
as soon as you're better.
2147
02:00:39,796 --> 02:00:41,047
I promise you.
2148
02:00:41,089 --> 02:00:41,840
Absolutely.
2149
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:43,299
You can start on another
in a very few months.
2150
02:00:43,299 --> 02:00:44,843
As soon as you're better.
2151
02:00:44,884 --> 02:00:46,136
No.
2152
02:00:47,554 --> 02:00:49,597
I don't believe you.
You're both lying.
2153
02:00:49,639 --> 02:00:52,142
You're lying!
It didn't die!
2154
02:00:52,142 --> 02:00:53,351
You took it!
2155
02:00:53,393 --> 02:00:56,229
You're lying!
You're witches!
2156
02:00:56,229 --> 02:00:57,647
You're lying!
2157
02:00:57,647 --> 02:01:02,318
You're lying! You're lying!
You're lying!
2158
02:01:11,327 --> 02:01:15,165
Abe says it's called prepartum.
2159
02:01:15,165 --> 02:01:17,333
I don't know.
It's some kind of a hysteria.
2160
02:01:18,668 --> 02:01:21,504
Boy, you were really kapow,
out of your mind.
2161
02:01:25,091 --> 02:01:29,345
Uh, I know where you got the idea
that Minnie and Roman were witches,
2162
02:01:31,514 --> 02:01:33,850
but, um, how come you thought that
Abe and I joined the party?
2163
02:01:38,146 --> 02:01:41,107
Um, let's face it, darling.
2164
02:01:41,149 --> 02:01:44,360
You had the prepartum crazies.
2165
02:01:45,945 --> 02:01:48,364
Now you're going to rest, and
you're going to get over them.
2166
02:01:50,784 --> 02:01:53,870
I know this is the worst thing
that ever happened to you,
2167
02:01:53,912 --> 02:01:56,581
but from now on, everything's
going to be roses.
2168
02:01:56,623 --> 02:01:58,625
Paramount's within an inch
of where we want them,
2169
02:01:58,666 --> 02:02:00,960
and suddenly Universal's
interested, too,
2170
02:02:01,002 --> 02:02:02,462
and we're going to blow this town,
2171
02:02:02,504 --> 02:02:04,714
and we're going to be in the
beautiful hills of Beverly
2172
02:02:04,756 --> 02:02:08,009
with a pool, a spice garden,
the whole schmeer,
2173
02:02:08,051 --> 02:02:10,053
and the kids, too, Ro.
2174
02:02:10,094 --> 02:02:12,222
Scout's honor.
You heard what Abe said.
2175
02:02:16,226 --> 02:02:18,520
Now, I got to run now and get famous.
2176
02:02:22,065 --> 02:02:23,900
Let me see your shoulder.
2177
02:02:27,362 --> 02:02:28,780
Let me see your shoulder.
2178
02:02:29,697 --> 02:02:31,074
Are you kidding?
2179
02:02:31,074 --> 02:02:32,408
Your left shoulder.
2180
02:02:33,910 --> 02:02:35,537
All right.
Anything you say.
2181
02:02:39,457 --> 02:02:40,917
I generally prefer doing this to music.
2182
02:02:42,335 --> 02:02:43,670
Left shoulder.
2183
02:02:46,714 --> 02:02:47,799
Right shoulder.
2184
02:02:51,594 --> 02:02:53,555
And that's as far as I go
without a blue light.
2185
02:02:59,102 --> 02:03:01,729
The high pressure area that we see here
2186
02:03:01,771 --> 02:03:03,439
has been causing this extreme
heat and humidity.
2187
02:03:04,274 --> 02:03:07,318
And unfortunately will be staying
with us city dwellers
2188
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:08,862
through the rest of the week.
2189
02:03:08,903 --> 02:03:12,282
It will be hot and overcast
upstate New York as well
2190
02:03:12,282 --> 02:03:15,785
with the possibility of thunder
showers tonight and tomorrow
2191
02:03:15,827 --> 02:03:18,788
with gradual clearing by tomorrow night.
2192
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:22,083
All you people leaving the city this
upcoming weekend should find it hot.
2193
02:03:46,441 --> 02:03:48,610
Do you hear a baby crying?
2194
02:03:49,819 --> 02:03:52,363
Why, no, I don't, dear.
2195
02:03:52,405 --> 02:03:54,324
Now, you come and get into your bed now.
2196
02:03:54,365 --> 02:03:55,617
It's time for you to take your pill.
2197
02:04:06,502 --> 02:04:09,255
Did you turn the air conditioner off?
Mm-hmm.
2198
02:04:09,297 --> 02:04:11,424
Well, you mustn't do that, dear.
2199
02:04:11,466 --> 02:04:13,885
Why, people are actually
dying, it's so hot.
2200
02:04:29,651 --> 02:04:31,361
What do you do with the milk?
2201
02:04:31,402 --> 02:04:34,364
Why, uh, throw it away.
2202
02:04:34,364 --> 02:04:35,657
Your pill, Rosemary.
2203
02:04:43,456 --> 02:04:46,042
Hello, girls.
2204
02:04:46,918 --> 02:04:49,379
Whew. 95 out.
2205
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:52,382
Some new people moved on in up in 8.
2206
02:04:54,008 --> 02:04:55,468
Do they have a baby?
2207
02:04:57,929 --> 02:04:58,930
How'd you know that?
2208
02:05:00,890 --> 02:05:02,100
I heard it crying.
2209
02:05:03,226 --> 02:05:04,394
Oh, wait a minute.
2210
02:05:08,481 --> 02:05:11,609
Oh, no.
Don't do that.
2211
02:05:11,651 --> 02:05:13,236
Why not?
2212
02:05:13,236 --> 02:05:16,030
Uh, a little messy, that's all.
2213
02:08:06,534 --> 02:08:07,994
Easy, easy.
2214
02:08:25,970 --> 02:08:27,930
Got her too high.
2215
02:08:48,117 --> 02:08:50,953
Not if he's still waiting
for a plane, he isn't.
2216
02:08:53,414 --> 02:08:55,833
Oh, hell, now, Hayato.
2217
02:08:55,875 --> 02:08:57,376
You're just making fun of me.
2218
02:08:57,418 --> 02:08:59,045
You're pulling my leg, like we say.
2219
02:09:25,446 --> 02:09:26,989
Aah!
2220
02:09:28,908 --> 02:09:31,285
Rosemary, go back to bed.
2221
02:09:31,327 --> 02:09:33,496
You know you're not supposed
to be up and around.
2222
02:09:33,496 --> 02:09:35,831
Is the mother?
Uh, Rosemary--
2223
02:09:35,873 --> 02:09:38,084
Shut up.
You're in Dubrovnik.
2224
02:09:38,084 --> 02:09:39,168
I don't hear you.
2225
02:10:24,297 --> 02:10:25,715
What have you done to it?
2226
02:10:26,924 --> 02:10:28,884
What have you done to its eyes?
2227
02:10:28,884 --> 02:10:30,720
He has his father's eyes.
2228
02:10:36,392 --> 02:10:37,560
What are you talking about?
2229
02:10:37,601 --> 02:10:39,228
Guy's eyes are normal.
2230
02:10:39,270 --> 02:10:43,065
What have you done to him,
you maniacs?
2231
02:10:43,065 --> 02:10:45,985
Satan is his father, not Guy.
2232
02:10:46,027 --> 02:10:49,530
He came up from hell and begat
a son of mortal woman.
2233
02:10:49,572 --> 02:10:50,573
Hail, Satan!
2234
02:10:50,614 --> 02:10:51,991
Hail, Satan!
2235
02:10:52,033 --> 02:10:55,911
Satan is his father, and
his name is Adrian.
2236
02:10:55,911 --> 02:10:58,831
He shall overthrow the mighty
and lay waste their temples.
2237
02:10:58,873 --> 02:11:02,668
He shall redeem the despised
and wreak vengeance
2238
02:11:02,710 --> 02:11:05,254
in the name of the burned
and the tortured!
2239
02:11:05,296 --> 02:11:06,630
Hail, Adrian!
2240
02:11:06,672 --> 02:11:07,757
Hail, Adrian!
2241
02:11:07,798 --> 02:11:09,508
Hail, Satan!
Hail, Satan!
2242
02:11:09,550 --> 02:11:10,801
Hail, Satan!
2243
02:11:10,843 --> 02:11:13,888
He chose you out of all the world.
2244
02:11:13,929 --> 02:11:15,973
Out of all the women in the
whole world, he chose you.
2245
02:11:16,015 --> 02:11:17,725
He arranged things because he wanted you
2246
02:11:17,767 --> 02:11:19,268
to be the mother of his only living son.
2247
02:11:19,268 --> 02:11:21,604
His power is stronger than stronger!
2248
02:11:21,604 --> 02:11:24,273
His might shall last longer than longer!
2249
02:11:24,315 --> 02:11:25,733
Hail, Satan!
2250
02:11:26,525 --> 02:11:28,319
No!
2251
02:11:28,361 --> 02:11:30,738
It can't be!
2252
02:11:31,322 --> 02:11:32,948
No!
2253
02:11:32,948 --> 02:11:34,283
Go look at his hands.
2254
02:11:34,325 --> 02:11:35,326
And his feet.
2255
02:11:37,703 --> 02:11:40,081
Oh, God!
2256
02:11:41,749 --> 02:11:45,461
God is dead!
Satan lives!
2257
02:11:45,503 --> 02:11:46,796
The year is one!
2258
02:11:46,837 --> 02:11:48,506
Hail, Satan!
Hail, Satan!
2259
02:11:48,547 --> 02:11:50,299
The year is one, and God is done!
2260
02:11:50,299 --> 02:11:51,592
Oh, God!
2261
02:11:51,634 --> 02:11:52,885
The year is one!
2262
02:11:52,927 --> 02:11:56,305
Hail, Adrian!
2263
02:11:56,305 --> 02:11:58,057
Hail, Satan!
2264
02:11:58,099 --> 02:12:00,810
Why don't you help us out,
Rosemary?
2265
02:12:00,851 --> 02:12:02,978
Be a real mother to Adrian.
2266
02:12:02,978 --> 02:12:04,814
You don't have to join
if you don't want to.
2267
02:12:04,855 --> 02:12:06,982
Just be a mother to your baby.
2268
02:12:08,901 --> 02:12:11,946
Minnie and Laura-Louise are too old.
2269
02:12:12,613 --> 02:12:13,948
It's not right.
2270
02:12:16,784 --> 02:12:17,952
Think about it, Rosemary.
2271
02:12:31,465 --> 02:12:33,509
Oh, God!
2272
02:12:33,509 --> 02:12:34,885
Oh, shut up with your "Oh, Gods,"
2273
02:12:34,927 --> 02:12:36,220
or we'll kill you, milk or no milk.
2274
02:12:36,262 --> 02:12:37,471
You shut up.
2275
02:12:37,513 --> 02:12:39,515
Rosemary's his mother, so
you show some respect.
2276
02:12:42,852 --> 02:12:44,687
Come, my friend.
2277
02:12:44,687 --> 02:12:47,022
Come see him.
Come see the child.
2278
02:12:57,408 --> 02:12:59,368
What would you like to drink?
2279
02:13:00,453 --> 02:13:02,705
They, uh, promised me
you wouldn't be hurt,
2280
02:13:02,705 --> 02:13:04,832
and you haven't been, really.
2281
02:13:06,709 --> 02:13:09,044
I mean, supposing you had
the baby, and you lost it.
2282
02:13:10,754 --> 02:13:12,131
Wouldn't that be the same?
2283
02:13:13,257 --> 02:13:14,925
And we're getting so much
in return, Ro.
2284
02:13:26,437 --> 02:13:30,274
Oh, Guy, let me introduce you
to Argyron Stavropoulos.
2285
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:33,068
How proud you must be.
2286
02:13:33,068 --> 02:13:34,987
Is this the mother?
2287
02:13:35,029 --> 02:13:36,572
Why in the name of--
2288
02:13:36,614 --> 02:13:38,574
Here, drink this.
You'll feel a little better.
2289
02:13:38,616 --> 02:13:39,909
What's in it?
Tannis root?
2290
02:13:39,950 --> 02:13:41,327
Nothing's in it.
2291
02:13:41,368 --> 02:13:43,579
Just plain, ordinary Lipton's
tea. You drink it.
2292
02:14:15,861 --> 02:14:18,239
Get away from here.
Roman.
2293
02:14:18,280 --> 02:14:20,699
You're rocking him too fast.
2294
02:14:20,741 --> 02:14:22,785
Sit down. Get her out of here.
2295
02:14:22,826 --> 02:14:23,953
Put her where she belongs.
2296
02:14:23,994 --> 02:14:25,454
You're rocking him too fast.
2297
02:14:25,496 --> 02:14:26,705
That's why he's crying.
2298
02:14:26,747 --> 02:14:27,790
Oh, mind your own business.
2299
02:14:27,790 --> 02:14:29,667
Let Rosemary rock him.
2300
02:14:29,708 --> 02:14:30,918
Go on, sit down with the others.
2301
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:32,127
Let Rosemary rock him.
2302
02:14:32,127 --> 02:14:33,295
Well, she's liable to--
2303
02:14:33,295 --> 02:14:35,422
Sit down with the others,
Laura-Louise.
2304
02:14:45,724 --> 02:14:47,101
Rock him.
2305
02:14:49,895 --> 02:14:51,647
You're trying to get me
to be his mother.
2306
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:55,192
Aren't you his mother?
